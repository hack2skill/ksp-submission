Simply download Lightning Rupee then register your personal data directly with a high pass rate It's really lucky to be able to find a loan application that really cares about its quota for borrowers, every time I make a loan on this Lightning Rupee application, there's no such thing as not getting a quota, I'm sure I'll get a quota, because I'm sure this application has a high quota Really it's a fake app. Approving rs 3000 loan. Out of that 1200 is processing charges they charge nd they are harrasing like they will share our nude photos to our contact and all. What to do. Don't ever install the app. Playstore should remove such kind of app. Don't ever use its an genuine request. Please dnt take loan from these people. They are completely fraud. They black mail you to pay the loan in inappropriate manner. Don't have sense . Even though if you pay on time than also they edit your pic and will send you on what's app. One of the worst app as i think.. even these people have advertised on Instagram also. How pathetic. Waste app to take loan. If you want a very good loan, especially one that can provide a loan with just a few steps, a simple application, fewer steps, less information to fill in, you know this Lightning Rupee application. This is not about the loan this is about why you even downloaded it. Don't try to download it they are fraudsters after giving permission they just steal your data and start blackmailing you.. I request Google to remove this app they are totally illegal.. Very horrible experience. Some loan company from this app just threat you so badly. They abuse you. I have suffered a scam from this app. They make me do the payment twice for the same loan. Worst experience, even we if we repay the amount the collection executive are threatening with the photos and black mailing. Google has to remove this kind of apps from play store I am very willing to leave the loan application that I usually use because I am already very interested in the Lightning Rupee application. Yes, although to be honest, this application is supposed to increase the width of the capital and loan cycles too. I think it's fraud App. They approved a loan amount of 3000 and also mentioned date of repayment is there in the App but even after 24 hours they have not disbursed the amount in my account. Checked application number of times for disbursal of amount but still no amount credited. Fake App. Never before have I found an online loan application like this Lightning Rupee application. In this Lightning Rupee application, the loan is very, very fast, I think this has really helped me a lot. Thank you Lightning Rupee For this one loan application, in my opinion, the loan application is quite good because, to be honest, I have used other applications, but they are not good enough, this Lightning Rupee application works for me and is good enough as it should I had not taken a loan from this app I have received link of this app and just click on link , the ones with 7 days, now take the payment in 6 days only. And all the numbers of my mobile threaten to speak for payment. I am troubled by this please help me. The loan apps name is Lightning Rupee And all this has hacked my mobile. He is threatening to message all my contacts. Play store is requested to close this app. Fake and Fruad App Please don't take loan in this app. I really like the online loan application, the features are very complete. And of course the features are very, very cool and helpful. In Lightning Rupee, paying off on time can reduce interest, I like this application. Thank you They are very bad app please They be asking before the date. They will call on what's up only if u not reply They will send ur all your contacts ur picture so please don't download app they are very dangerous. This is a very big scam. I have applied for loan and before the payment due date (27th November 2022) I am getting a whatsapp message on (26th November 2022) from them with all my documents and and upload selfie threating me, that if I don't make the payment they will upload my documents on the porn websites and also edit my selfie photo with the porn actor. Also they are charging 40% interest rate for 7 days of borrowing. It's a very big Scam and Google should remove this app. Hi, I have used this app. It's fraud. I have paid all the loans and still they say it's not received and claiming that I didn't pay, I shared them the ss of payments.still they are saying to pay again. Also different msgs I am receiving for the loan I didn't take.These frauds are using villagers phone number and not there own phones. This is fraud app. It doesn't ask any details to check your credit score and send some amount of money. I have got credited some 1800 and asking to pay 3000. It does not have any contact details or helpline email to raise issue. This is froad apps.. You will say that we have given you this much payment. Right now you will not have to pay that much, but they do not show any transaction ID from their side.... If you do not pay according to their saying, then they start blackmailing you... Threatens to send nude photos... If Google Play Store gives space to such apps, then a case should be filed against them as well... What is India's cybercrime, why it does not step in front of it, it is not understood yet..... Fraud loan application. Kindly don't prefer it. Same is the version of Swift loan application which I'd banned as a scam and removed from playstore. They are asking money within 6 days high interest rate harrasing on calls and morphing photos and sending fake notices. I have paid my money on time whatever I took every time I took and it's not my first time to take. But the customer service after payment he threatened me if I don't pay again to the UPI number he sent in WhatsApp he will contact all my contacts number n edit to pornstar and send my nudes photo to all my contacts.

I shared all the payment details yet they are saying we didn't received the payment. Total fraud. Oh yes, the several timely repayments that I made when I was on the Lightning Rupee loan application were quite good. One of them is that it can make me add to the loan limit amount and reduce interest, I like this application, thank you very much.

But when I try Lightning Rupee it's the opposite. this is really the best and I know this application from my friends/relatives. I have applied many times and have used it for a certain period of time, the difference from what I feel in the Lightning Rupee application with other applications is quite a lot. I think it will be an easy answer to choose which application. It is not good app it shows 20000 and after applying a pop shown to me wait 45 minute after some time I open the app and loan ammount convert to 20000 to 3000 what is this, this is not good and after time they refused 🤣🤣🤣 thanks for refuse I don't want 3000 loan. please don't waste your time In my personal opinion, you must try this application. Other loan applications just make us annoyed before trying them too. But here it's really different, the loan is fast, the process is easy and it doesn't make you bother and stress if you go to Lightning Rupee mah As long as they can definitely guarantee to protect my privacy, I will always trust the Lightning Rupee app. Because for now I rarely see any application that guarantees high. Thanks for being different. We really don't care about the quality that is provided by the Lightning Rupee loan application. When I am given convenience in the form of a reduction in interest when I make repayments on time, it can make me reduce my loan interest. I like this app, thank you. Indeed, one of the coolest applications is Lightning Rupee. I have repeatedly paid off loans here, always late. As a result, I can get a reduction in loan interest. I like this app, thank you very much. I remember very well that using the Lightning Rupee application made me solve financial problems very easily and simply. I don't know anymore if this mace application looks like it's going to be difficult. The application is indeed very helpful.

Address:Jhoola Pul Ram Bag Rambag, Mandla, Madhya Pradesh 481668",1.8498789,3636,"I recommend it to everyone. Everyone likes it. You can try to upload all the information immediately. I look forward to passing the review in order to realize my entrepreneurial dream. I believe in this application. It is very easy to use, the service is very timely, and it can also solve my loan problems. Help me successfully find a regular loan amount. I have successfully approved the support and finally have a reliable loan platform. I have applied for the loan amount I want. I still find it very convenient to use and can be used for a long time. An absolutely fraud company. It asks you for initial payment and then keeps you await. Again they ask money for fast approval in the queue and after the payment they state that the loan has been disbursed but no amount is credited in your account. When mailed about the issue, noboby replies, no call back is arranged. It's fraud guys. Do not fall for their tricks.😡😡😡😡 So this app is really cool and saves me from overdraft, twice overdraft in 6 weeks. If you know that you need the money within 3-4 days, then an advance payment of $75 is very good, because the money is free if you choose 3 days delivery. If you need it within 8 hours, you need to pay $5, which is understandable. I recommend this everywhere to people who usually make a living on a salary and need a little help to put it all together. This is indeed a very good helper for me when dealing with urgently needed loans. It solved a lot of funding problems for me. Very convenient, fast and reliable. The form of borrowing is very safe. This is indeed a very trustworthy borrowing application. Recommend to everyone. This is totally a fake application. They are collecting some amount in the form of registration. Later they say that you will be getting a call from banks or financial institution... it never happens The comments which were mentioned on the application are created by the developers of the application... Be careful...Don't trust it My rating is 2 star because I applied for a Rs 15000 loan and the process was smooth, paid security deposit and the speed up fee and got an answer that loan disbursed but didn't get the money in my bank account. When I post a query the app says to find my loan status in records but there is no tab in the app to check records I will rate again when I get the money. Everything is superb but I didn't get my credit even after paying all the charges the app asked for. Very worst don't trust this app and make the fee after paying they will say you are in que wait for 15 days other wise they will ask you to pay extra money for quick processes. I have made the payment you said but it's almost 10 days gone still you guys are saying wait for 6 days. Its a fake app they are collecting money and datas only. Even they doesn't have a customer service number I would like to give zero stars......😡😡😡 It is not a loan provider,it is just a fake app that want your money only. Firstly they show you how much amount you need and then asking for security deposit but after you pay money to them there is no any option shown for applying or withdrawal or disbursed money this is totally fake app I lost my approximately 1000 in this scam so please do not trust this app Many time I emailed them fir help but no reply is there I also have screenshot of my payment that I had paid to this app so becareful. I live on salary. Whenever I need cash to cover anything from gas or groceries to paying bills, I usually only ask one family member. But I hate to owe people money. It's great to borrow money from yourself. At first I was skeptical about joining because I thought, filming, how unorganized I am in terms of money, I would use this method to do unnecessary things. However, since I can set it to automatically pay from my account, repayment is very easy. So far, I like everything about this app! If you do not use it, you have no right to speak. The software runs smoothly and the page is simple. It is the best loan software of its kind, with simple operation, practical functions and convenient borrowing. To be honest, many people may say yes, maybe the product is faulty, maybe they charge high fees or don’t accept certain banks, but for this procedure, I can’t believe how quickly I receive the required funds when I don’t have one. . ...........It really caught me off guard, but honestly, I recommend this app to anyone who only needs a small amount of money to spend a week, there are no hidden fees, tipping is optional , But always thank you again, thank you for getting me out of trouble This is a fraud app. Please don't use this. I've applied for a loan,they ask to deposit some amount for disburse,I pay. Then pormpting for faster disbuse of within 5 min again some amount,I also pay that. But there is no money credited to my account. Beware from this app. I lost my money,but I don't want anyone loose his/her hard earn money at crunch time Its very bad experience because i deposited processing for loan amount and also fast processing charges And its showing my loan disbursed but amount not updated in my account whats going on its fraud or what i think its fake because no customer care number what should i do .. Its fraud app dont download its very bad experience...i mail so many times but still not updated I have been using this program for about 2 months and they are definitely a trustworthy company. They lend you money, and they will try to charge you on your next payday, but say that you have very little money and don’t have enough money to repay it. No charge! There is a fee to get your money faster, but it is cheap and you can choose to tip whatever you want, or nothing. In general, excellent apps come in handy and are free. Love this app...I am very short and need some cash to help me through the difficulties, he immediately transferred it to my bank! love it Since I started using this app (during this pandemic, you never know what will happen). It has been experienced in many situations...I don’t know what I would do without it! Only a few dozen small fees (transfer on the same day), the money will arrive quickly. If you are between work (as I did before) and the amount you pay back is feasible, they will sometimes allow payment, so your expenses will not exceed your ability! Thanks I saw all good reviews about this app & applied for loan but it's been 2 days now, my loan has not yet come. Even I paid processing fees of Rs. 1199 along with speed loan within 24 hours charges Rs. 226 extra, total Rs. 1425 paid but still there's no response nor any call from the Get Loan App/ Company. It's fake & fraud company, pls don't download this app as my money got wasted. They lure you with fast & easy loan but they never give, instead they charge you huge amount & don't return back. This is a complete 💯% fraud and scam app because they take charges in the name of loan approval and processing fees. And also in the name of speed sanction but after payingbthe amount they say loan disbursed but never get the amount in the bank... And when contacted them through email which is the only option they don't reply.. this is totally fraud so plz be aware The super convenient loan software application is very simple, and the approval reached the account quickly, which also solved my urgent needs. Good loan software Every time I don't want to borrow money from a friend, the software is very good, I have this loan, and the payment speed is very fast. High efficiency solved my recent difficulties. He will allow you to borrow money and charge very little interest. The best part is that you can repay him a few days later without any problems. If you have no overdraft on the day of repayment, there is no overdraft fee. When you get funds in your account, it will only continue to pull. No negative points! ! Yes! So far, I have borrowed and repaid more than 4 times. Always pass! I like it! All legal and not interesting business! It, s a scam app, they taken money from you for loan processing charges, then again ask for money for boost up your loan application, they given time but that time never came.I applied but they scamed me twice, almost 15 days are gone and no sign of money, they had no customer related options in their app, it, s scam. I already make a police complaint about this app, and very soon I file a case against them in highcourt also. They are playing with our data and our emotions. I was actually a little nervous adding this app because I was worried that the withdrawal of money from my account was just a scam, but to my surprise, it wasn't. I was running low on gas and didn't get paid until the next day, so I used this app and I got my money in minutes, you just pay back what you borrowed and tip your choice! Definitely worth it if you get stuck! ! ! ! I am super impressed! Easy to use, funds arrive in seconds. I love this app! As a commuter with a long commute, it would be great to be able to get a small gas fund loan if I want to work an overtime or two! Great idea, great implementation, so easy to use! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ At first app show you to pay some amount to get ur loan quickly to skip que duration, then they ask you to pay for fast cash card to get your loan fast disbursal. Fraud Fake cheat 👎😡😡,no contact Number and Email address mentioned you will not get response Shock to see how the ratings and reviews goes 4 +above didn't expect disagree with reviews and rating. I would like to know your disbursement time since I paid 700 plus 326 for Fast Card process yesterday but still my amount is not credited to my account. Looking for your reply on immediate basis. There is no revert till date from this app founder. My request to everyone that you can get loan from direct service provider like Creditbee and Navi You won't loose money like this organisation. don't use this app... fraud app...it shows enquiry time asking some security deposit amount for emi processing.. after that I paid amount next it's shows waiting list queint lacks...again asking 326 rs for faster aproval of my loan...I also done this again I apaid 326..rs..after completing two payments...it shows next third party apps link ...it is very bad experience I lost 1000 rs .....don't trust this type of apps As I paid their fee they started showing loan approved. After some time shown loan disburse. No amount credited in account. They are fooling by taking registration fee. Why Google allows such apps into their play store. And helps such apps to loot people. It's really disgusting. I have been using the program for 1 month and it is one of my preferred applications when I have paid all the large bills and insufficient funds. The app also provides you with alerts about when your account may be overdrawn, which is very helpful. highly recommended! This is the worst app which I have see in my life totally fraud means totally fraud.Seriously i install this app by seeing the review but seriously this is the biggest mistake which I have done they take money as confirmation after they didn't give me a loan i pay the money on 23 on December but till now I didn't get loan if they can't able to give then they should atleast return the money back This app broke my trust I will surely change the review only after getting the loan or my money back. It's a scam app....very very worst app They will take money from you.. n also it's not safe..they want all your bank information...and in the end they will show you that... your loan is passed wait for (6days)(12 hours)...and after 6 days they will reject your loan.. very bad experience They asked to pay for faster processing of loan and when paid it shows the amount is disbursed and the amount is yet to be credited to my account i think this is a fake app they are just collecting money and i am going to file a police complaint againt this i want my money back and the payment made goes to some brijendra It's been 3 days since I paid extra fees as asked, but the app says your loan is disbursed, but until now, no amount has been received. I think it's a way to scam and get fees from us. Don't trust this app is totally fake first you apply and it will ask you some information to verify after that your loan is disabled but pain some amount call fees after that they give you also told that if you want faster loan in your bank account pay more to get loan amount faster in your account. Number one fraudulent app and do not believe to this app. They ask to deposit 1299 before the disburses of amount and again they ask that your loan is on line so for quick disburse send Rs 325. I deposited both but no any disburse of loan even within 48 hours. Do not put your trust in such a fraudulent app. Not less than chronic thief Full clearance paymet done but loan amount not credited in account. Most of relavent loan aaps are done the same scams. I have already paid for mostly 1000/- for loan. They didn't give their loan amount. Bad experience in app it's showing loan is disbursed but I didn't receive any amount. There is no option in app to check the loan details or profile info Actually it is fake app, because it ask deposit amount, and I paid, but still I didn't get any loan amount, this app is not eligible for even single star, 🙏🏻🙏🏻 please don't cheat like this for poor people, because poor people only applying for loan soo... It's should be black list. I want money so I downloaded the app fill the process.all things.afterthey asked money 699/-for intial fee.so give.they showing me your loan in queu for fast forward they asked more 326/- i send but money is bot come to account what can I do.so i think it's totally froud company I paid twice to get a loan but I didn't get. This is a fake app pls don't trust this app and there is no availability to talk to customer care. Do not go for this app. All the positive reviews are absolutely fake The whole process from start to finish was very easy. I'm really nervous, especially now that I can't get a payday loan for the holidays. I saw an ad on Facebook and read some reviews and decided to give it a try. I downloaded the app, followed all instructions and was approved, and the money was deposited into my account within hours. I absolutely recommend it to anyone. It really helps when the times are difficult. I can always think of him in difficult times, even when you want extra money to buy things. It really works. ..... All requests are made to keep it going. I would rather pay the monthly fee like that, plus make money.",Praja093pati,gmail.com,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,full network access prevent device from sleeping view network connections,1

This app is okay But Service is not available in Bangalore, Just data weste time weste if u not available over location then mentioned properly only this areas is available okay other wise all ok Worst app. after adhar verification they are showing that sorry we are facing some technical issue please try again later Such third class app this app will charge you more than 500 plus gst as convenience fee first they'll give you 3000 rs of credit Limit and if you use rs 1 or 3000 they'll charge you more than 500 each n every month and when call the customer care about deactivating my account they are telling uninstall the app I found the app to be very convenient to use. I was able to get credit in 10 minutes. My card is blocked but no one responding this is wrost service in fatapay contact customer support but.

I will recommend it to my friends as well. Do not use this app I was used 700 rs from this app and they charged 589rs convenience fee on it. 71 percent convinced fee charging Good for instant loan and the best thing is they have scan and pay option just like Google pay and phone pay. You give all details and then you see exit button.. No reasons are explained. Fake app, don't waste your time, don't share your details.. Who knows what are they doing with that? Payment done on time but thay take extra charges. I m not satisfied. thaka hua app. this is second time thay charge extra charges. The app runs really smoothly and also works with weak data connection although its my personal experience. All my transactions are fast and i never faced any difficulty. My personal experience was amzing. The app is very friendly and intutive. I completed the overall process from installing the app to getting the disbursement in my app about in 10 minutes .it is fantastic !!! App working very slow and taking so long time for any payment. so plz improve this problem. Cannot login, there are bugs in the app inspite of entering otp manually also I am unable to login,😢☹️ Which problem my account not open I have having good repayment track and Good CIBIL SCORE if you pls rechack my application I have all payment on time repaid so can you pls such guide and apruve my limit because I have genuine good customer.

Lets pocketly!",3.7611465,17204,"Worst app it give me 10000 loan a I paid 2000.they are not giving that 2000 and I made repayment in time to time they were saying u have to pay your total loan amount.then your profile go on verification after that verification you get your new loan .but my frd paid all dues and now it is saying you are not eligible for loan App is not processing amount after did repayment on time why it's happening many times, please update your service, in account showing your amount will credit in your account in 3-4 hours, but I didn't get any amount till 15 hours completed It is very nice and trusted app for student loan. It gives loan without any income proof. It gives loan on the basis of adhar card and pan card. It is very nice app. I am giving 5 star to this app. Despite of having good payment history they have saying you are not eligible for new loan. I was stuck in medical emergency and paid my dues to reapply again but went shocked because of showing not eligible. Worst app for me now. I've been using this app since the February 2022 experience, and I've never had a problem with a Payment or Re-payment app that works very well, is user-friendly and has no access to credit limits. in easy. Every periodic payment, you can also extend your loan if you are unable to pay the renewal fee on the very short due date. He can. This is all from my experience. 😊😊 But I am not late this payment I have medical emergency and please unblock my credit limit This app is totally fake I apply for 2 days but Pocketly app is not responce. I submitted my all documents and kyc time is too longer. I wait for kyc 2 days but not apply me. So I request to all people avoid for this app. This is totally fake app. Its a bad experience with me happen with pocktly I have cleared my loan which i had taken july was cleared on October but till now loan didn't closed and still reflecting as overdue in my CIBIL report. I have mailed as well as sent message through WhatsApp several times which they meant as 24hrs service. No reply for mail also. Now i couldn't apply for any new loan also and it's really reflecting bad on my cibil report. My CIBIL also getting low so kindly update me ASAP its not good thing. I have never ever seen like Pocketly apps, asking over documents to process. And even submitting every need documents it's saying could not process. Unless Pocketly apps, No response from them the app is not working last six days payment is delayed now they saying your not eligible for new loan i doing payments on time but still they stopped the limit and not responding to any mail and message Very Poor service is provided by pocketly. Taking very long time at the end showing 36 your wait time. Is it a scam may be only data collecting they are. Yesterday I have paid the loan amount but your team was telling it was not received yet I have proof also. Is your team didn't have respect and are you playing games with me that it is a technical issue and something so and so... Seriously I am so angry in your team about that matter and especially doing fine it was .............. Finally my order is close the loan amount immediately and don't tell it will be refunded within 5 to 8 days. I don't need refund just clear the loan immediately. One of the waste app i have ever seen. I have kept loan disbursement but not credited into my account it's already 6 hours finished. But why they are saying instant loan it's not correct to say like that Had a good experience until the app suddenly started asking for more documents and doesn't proceed further on trying. Worst servers you guys have. It seems the rating here on play store is fake Worst experience,I am loyal customer from 2 years but due to 1 late payment they had cancelled my limit. After contacting the customer support,they are unable to help me. Installed 4 day ago and still not able to use it coz app not able to update even pan card and birth date. After sending videos to support team not responding. Poor experience. I paid all my dues within the due date. But, They rejected me and throw into Waitlist. And said, Please re apply after 6months. Very Worst Worst app. They didn't support you in tough times and said, please go, and come after 6 months. If you have a problem now, wat to do after 6months. Bloddy Cheap app. Don't install. #BantheseType Of Cheap apps.. 🖕🖕 Worst app, they don't understand the problem of person who have taken the loan, they directly take action they don't give time if there is any problem, and even the worst service ever, don't take any loan from here and block this It is a good app but in present yesterday I digitally signed on loan agreement but still amount didn't disburse. I had also wrote email to customer care but they didn't reply yet. I've been using the app for a long time, sufficient for small purchases, recently, my limit has been increased to 4000,but still I'm not able to get the amount, please Pocketly, fix it ASAP Very bad feel with pocketly.alredy paid the loan and uninstalled the application.now they will sending message day by day to pay the money. the fraud application is it . don't be trapped. I missed the payment for 2 months due to financial and personal reasons. Collections team is reaching out to my contacts of my phone instead of my references. When checked they are saying we gave them the authority to access our contacts list. Accessing users personal data. This is against RBI rules. Along with that their behaviour with the users is really really bad. When I said the reason is too big and need to wait for the payment, the agent told it's not out business. I used pay on time. Previously This App Was Good. I Used To Pay On Time Always But Only Once, I Failed To Pay On Time Because Of Medical Issues, My Limit Was Blocked. I Paid Later With Late Fine And It's Been Months And Still My Limit Is Blocked. Nothing Customer Friendly Here. Total Waste. Waste app and to much interest this app taking and don't install and don't use this app... it's my request to all to much interest they are taking and not increasing the limit....plz waste app Loan amount and to much tax they are taking..... O star. .. i take loan from 1 year and all ways I pay in time .. today I pay all my loan.. no see me that my behaviour was bad.. don't give any loan.. why do this . Very bad app.. never seen any app ... Very bad experience... They called and reminder sms.. but no see that what happens Not at all good 34 hours has been completed and another 34 had being compleing but it still not approved it's fake app don't install it any one If you require loan in less time, you have to try Pocketly, i am saying this because i was helped in need by the app, i was quickly declared eligible for availing their Collateral-free loan facilities. My loan is overdue from last 3 days .... I'm trying to pay it but evertime it shows payment failed ......How is this possible please helpe out with this issue rest everything is good Pocketly has always delivered perfect quality features with a very exciting interface that I am very happy with Pocketly. Worst app I have ever seen,, this is fraud app ,, they take data loan was processing 1 hour,, after 1 hour the disbursal amount does'nt credit in our account The application process was comparatively long and have an error at the end. Bad UX. Pocketly has the fastest disbursal process. When one needs money faster and in small amount, I would say don’t shy from approaching these guys. Firstly thanks to app. The app is very nice and new update is awesome. From Last few months many problems are occurring but now they have solved all the issues. Only negative point is that app has fixed the loan limit of 10000 but if they increase limit than it will be best because at the time the people who are paying loan they are not getting any benefit of the app. They are Just taking loan and paying. Lack of interest will be seen in customer. So please increase loan limit as per criteria. Suddenly after using pocketly for more than 6 months, and now suddenly they blocked my account and for no exact reason at all, been asking them for help but no response and even when they gave a response it's always the same for every different inquiry, utterly disappointed. Suddenly my profile was not suitable for them. Very poor support and no responsibility at all. Innovative at its best. I have been a Pocketly customer, satisfied for the entire 30 day period. I dnt find any useful about this app.2 times i took loan and pay on time without delaying but stil my limit is same,cannot took more than 500 funny 🤣 I ran out of cash for books purchase and was desperate to get money, Pocketly helped me with the amount of 13.5 thousand at very fast speed. Recently i took a loan from pocketly, love that the whole process of applying for loan was smooth and it happened in a few clicks itself. Customer service is good, disbursement is fast, Less documentation, all necessary checkpoints covered, Pocketly is the best Documentation part is the touhest when you seek loans, however mty experience with Pocketly says otherwise. It was a very breezy affair. I have applied for a loan but the amount has not been credited yet it has been more then 12 hours and even the customer support isn't replying to my queries",support,pocketly.in,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,control vibration create accounts and set passwords full network access prevent device from sleeping view network connections receive data from Internet,0

I always repay the amount on time. On or before the due date. But today when I made the payment my credit limit got low which is really unfair as it is clearly mentioned in your terms that making payments on time will increase your credit limit. However on every payment it doesn't it depends it sometimes increases otherwise it remain the same.I otherwise loved the app as it has been really helpful but unnecessary decreases are not require😞 This app was good before. But now it keeps on crashing . Oops something went wrong keeps on popping. Also even after having credit limit of 8000 we cannot take full of it. We will have to take 2000 at a time. So frustrating. I have been using this app since a long time and was happy with it but suddenly after update the app isn't working properly. And they have added shopping to the list. Lol. First work on the smooth functioning of app. All you can do is say we regret for your inconvenience. Good app for immediate funds. Only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't let you take more than 2000 at once even if your credit limit is 19000. EDITED : Its stuck on one page. WE ARE SYNCING. For almost 1 month now its still syncing my data. Worst customer service i have ever seen. I've already made one of the payments and the bank has confirmed that the amount has been successfully credited to your account but you haven't updated it yet. Moreover, I have created tickets also but you have been closing the tickets without providing any resolution. I'll call my bank and file for the chargeback. Once pay all the amount, I'm never using your services again. Worst experience ever. Disgusting experience. I've been using this app for years. And now suddenly my credit limit decreased when paying my dues on time. None of your customer care number is reachable and none of my mails get replied. After every repayment my credit limit is decreasing 😠 Disgusting experience. I've been using this app for years. And now all of a sudden my credit limit decreased despite of paying my dues on time. None of your customer care number is reachable and none of my mails get replied. Everything is fine but think at very least I deserve to know the prior reason. hope you could get back to me and solve the query. Worst and pathetic customer service. I've already made one of the payments and the bank has confirmed that the amount has been successfully credited to your account but you haven't updated it yet. Moreover, I have shared emails and created multiple tickets but you have not be responding at all and have been closing the tickets without providing any resolution. I'll call my bank and file for the chargeback. Once I pay all the amount, I'm never using your services again. Worst experience ever. I used this app from couple of years now . Everything was going perfectly fine . I even repay all my dues before time . But from the last month, whenever I pay my loan it shows ""you are late to pay"" and my paid amount get blocked . All my documents are approved from more than 6months now, but still no increase in my limit, instead of that they started blocking my credit limit whenever i pay the due. One took loan from you because he is in trouble, but you blocked 10k in the same month. I am extremely disappointed with the service provided by Mpocket. Despite always making timely payments on all of my loans, my browsing limit was suddenly decreased without any explanation. I reached out to customer service to inquire about this change and received no satisfactory response. It is unacceptable for a company to make changes to a customer's account without proper communication and justification. Furthermore, the customer service provided was unhelpful and unprofessional. Disgusting experience. I've been using this app for years. And now all of a sudden my credit limit decreased despite of paying my dues on time. None of your customer care number is reachable and none of my mails get replied. Everything is fine but I think at very least I deserve to know the prior reason. I hope you could get back to me and solve the query. Worst and pathetic customer service. I've already made one of the payments and the bank has confirmed that the amount has been successfully credited to your account but you haven't updated it yet. Moreover, have shared emails and created multiple tickets but you have not be responding at all and have been closing the tickets without providing any resoluBy mistake on my part, Ayka Loan was credited twice and my account was debited twice. The money was debited from the account twice for one loan. I took a loan. The amount got disbursed but the amount is not credited. I tried calling the customer care, they are always busy. And it's very hard to find customer support in the app. I won't repay the loan if i don't get the amount credited in my account. Sorry mPokket, you guys have to work and fix many things. Hoping for best. Regards Shib Editing my review.... Very Bad service... I always pay/extend my dues on time and my record is 100% on time. But the way of callings agents are very bad and on due date they started messaging for due amount on my alnlternate number. This is very bad experince for me. Altleast you have to check the customers record after that decide the way of talking sending messages on Alternate numbers. Now zero star from my side. Very misleading app. I got a call in the morning stating if I clear all my dues. They will increase my credit limit but to my surprise it reduced my credit limit. Even after repaying all of the loans on time without any delay, not even a single time and being a users more than 6 months. Very bad experience. Worthless app. It's a scam. They give you around ₹425 and ask you to pay back ₹500. The app will constantly log you out so you won't even know when the due date is arriving, you can't repay the amount till you update the app. If you pay amount before the due date, your borrowing limit stays the same. It might seem like a good option in times of need but trust me it's not worth the trouble. Might as well take it from a friend or the bank. I have been using this app for some time now. I have an issue with the payment. I paid the amount back and it showed successful. Now when I check my loan is still in the app. I have raised 2 tickets regarding this. Haven't received any calls or feedback from them. The worst part is they show that the problem is resolved. I do believe that they are robbing people. If the team behind that app has any intention of solving my issue, please cantact me. If not, then go rob a bank not your customers. These days I'm seriously not impressed by how things are running on mpokket. Been a user for almost three years now. My credit limit is now 10000 but for some reason after repaying all the loans, im not able to take new loans anymore. The app just keeps me on hold asking to verify my account number the same account number I have been using, for almost three years now, Even after I showed in details about my account number, its still on pending, oh my God! Yesterday I applied for the loan but the disbursed amount has not yet been credited to my account. Although it shows in the app that it has been disbursed , but i have not yet received it. It's really disappointing. And if it's not credited today I will not pay for it. Their customer support is worst even after reaching them, I haven't seen a single reply from them utterly disappointing 😞😞😞 I have made the payment and still not able to see the available credit have also send an email along with the payment screen shot attached but still no response on email and we do not even have an option to contact customer service except sending an email and after sending emails still no response. I am trying to get onto that link but getting server error and I don't know how to get in touch with your'll I have also written so many emails on support but still no response Overall the app is really helpful..... But importantly soon after the completion of my profile various calls have been coming like to increase the credit limit you have to take loan right now to enjoy the benefits.... It's really annoying actually...i just woke up and they are asking me to take loan at a time I don't need it..... whenever i need it i will surely take it.....they don't need to call for that so many times not only one person..... different person are calling for the same thing I just installed the app and these people are calling/forcing me to take loan and the kind of documentation process so hard and also I am concerned there will be no privacy, they can circulate my data anywhere they want , plus the app is so slow you feel like switching to another app which can give you faster approval I would really recommend try for another option for faster loan rather than trying this app, its just waste of time, try fibe, Navi or Money view mPokket is a decent app for urgent funds with nominal charges. It's good because the transaction process is simplified and withdrawal is instant, as the money is transferred within time limit. I would recommend this app for everyone who intents to apply for financial services and are diligent with timely payments. For others, if they don't pay on time then it's not the app, it's your cibil which will impact. Be careful and stress-free. Thanks mPokket for being their. Regards, Inzpire Very useless app because it gives loan easily but even if you have paid the amount, it shows in your civil. Then no matter how much you email, you will not get any solution, I have been sending mail for the last one year to close my account but till now no response has come. Hello, I requested for a loan this morning but the amount has not been credited to my account while the app shows ""Disbursed"". On top of that, the app keeps crashing. Kindly, look into it. I still haven't received the loan amount!!! Hello I have been trying to get through to you!!! Please reply. The loan amount has not been disbursed into my account yet. Updated review : I have been taking small amount of loans from MPokket since several years. The last time I took a loan was on 19th July, 2022 because gratefully my income was supporting my expenses but today, I was short in cash. As it's Month-end, I required atleast 2k. I did not ask a friend/colleague, I opened the app, applied for the loan and got 2k. Next month, when the salary will arrive, I'll pay back. Interest rate is okay because this app helps you when you need it the most! There is no option of giving zero stars or else I would give zero stars. The shittiest loan app I've ever seen. I always repay my loan time to time and today too and they always deduct my credit limit the money i repay. I've been a member of this like 1-2 years and they are doing this to me in my bad times. I would always recommend not to take loan from this app 😡. Team pocket Vishant 23/11/22 Im experiencing same issues above mentioned. I am using this app for the past 5 months and every time i will repay the loan amount before due date. Now i couldn't repay the loan because of the app doesn't work properly. Whenever i click on the activity page it's just show that "" oops something went wrong"" for a long time and i tried for so many time. Please Give me a solution . Very disappointed with the custom service. Cant connect to any agent. Mail them as well and they were supposed to reach me for the issue i highlighted them. I cant request for any new loan due to primary device issue however i'm on my primary device only. This used to be one of the great apps but losing it dignity day by day. Worst experience... After many failed attempts and false comittments, I finally got 2k from them... Now here's the worst part... They keep asking you to upload your bank statements in few formats inc pdf, which I did and they keep rejecting it again and again for the past one month now, thought of reaching out to customer support about this issue there's no help or contact option in the app and when they call you? It's just a bunch of unprofessional agents who don't resolve ur issue at all... After giving my review it's very nice to see that they have given are very immediate response and I really appreciate the service they are providing sonli I am giving 5 sta... This was a great app which helps me in when I needed I really thankful to the mpokket which they invented this great. but only one minus point I saw that is they will increase the credit limit immediately but if we didn't pay minimal amount also immediately they will decrease the credit limit this is unfair. First of all App is having tech issues and Its taking too much time to process all loans. I have applied for loan but still not credited to my bank account. I have already sent so many mails but not getting a single response from your side and also tried to contact you over the call but still issue is same. No response till now. I can't expect this kind of service from Mpocket. Really pathetic service I've been using mpocket for a year now. It helped me a lot in some cases and overall experience is also very good. But my last transaction was a mess.. The amount was not credited in my account but the loan was disbursed on their side.So for now i cannot risk to take a loan again😂 until they resolve this issue. In the past, I have given a single star for UI this app had. But since then, it has been a go-to app in the time of crunch. UI been improved much better in the later updates. It is the incremental loan giving app means you have to build up your profile to get higher amounts. So if you want 10-15K as soon as you sign up then it's not the one. Worst app and worst customer support. Money has been deducted from my account but they haven't changed loan status for 4 days and charged me additional charges as late fee. Don't use this app. Very poor service. They don't even solve your issues. I have been using for 4 years and now after increasing my credit limit, they have downgraded it. Even after paying the dues on correct time this is what I'm facing while other apps are good at increasing credit limit after all these loyal transaction. Turning out to be a complete waste application as time passes.. Been using it for the last 4 years and it is now harrasing me everyday but i haven't even done a single payment late. I have decided to quit this application as soon as i can and i will encourage you to do so too. And for someone downloading it for the first time be aware and dont get stuck in its loop it is comoletely controlled by uneducated highly unprofessional group of people. I have paid my loan yesterday..and after money got deducted..in the app it was showing that something wrong . And when I checked after some time the same loan which I paid is still showing as due .i have raised a ticket saying the same..but no response from there side .and when I checked today they have added rs 8 as intrest.. Don't know what is happening.. I have already paid for it . Then why its showing like this. Why should I pay the intrest. This app keeps modifying our limit and they will make it become low and much low. And along with this a huge transaction charges are here I advise you to take pocketly app which is far better than this or you can take a secure credit card which all the best option above all this and starting at just 2k There is no calling option for the second time. Once you talk and ask for more documents we provide those also after then no reply. I called several times even uh said that we will arrange a call in 1 hour which wasn't done. I don't think this app is worth a single star. Uh are just faking emotions and taking our documents so uh can use them wrongly I have taken a loan extension for 15 days and soon after a week i get a call asking to repay the amount and my limit will get increased. I made the payment same day itself but my limit was same. No response in call and email. Just gave the false commitment and a week before made me to repay loan amount. Than what's the use of taking an loan extension.",info,mpokket.com,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Google Play license check change your audio settings control vibration create accounts and set passwords full network access prevent device from sleeping read Google service configuration run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

Our Office Address: WeWork BKC, C - 20, G Block Rd, G Block BKC, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra East, Mumbai, Maharashtra",4.473032,922414,"I have been using it for a year now, the experience is very good compared to others in the industry. They don't spam, no ads and great customer support are its positives. Although the processing fee may feel a bit expensive but it may be because of very nature of personal loans, hope they give me a waiver of processing fee someday. This loan app used to be my go-to, because it used to be consistent. But for the past 6months I noticed they give you loan and encourage you to pay early.. instead of you getting an increment, the loan reduces drastically. So I don't see a reason why you should pay promptly.. That's very bad and if you can deal with your plans been altered after you made plans from the money you think you might get from an app but you don't... then go ahead. I just can't deal with inconsistency Branch loan app is definitely the best! Easy access to requested funds, reasonable interest rate, workable tenure, great customer service and generally satisfying experience. Please keep it up. Thanks The app is easy to use but what worries is their criteria for a reloan. One strives to maintain a good loaning history with the app but suddenly gets denied credit on claims of not meeting the threshold when you've always paid on time and without any default hisyory. I think it's very close to conmanship. Then to be told to wait for 90 days to make another application is most annoying. It offers loans @ flexible payment periods. The only issue i have is the criteria used some times. I have been loyal for the longest time and seen great limit growth. This time I paid and on reapplying facility has been denied. Other factors have been constant and on a positive trajectory. I hope you can review your lending criteria and look at several factors. Otherwise I love branch for it's service Poor performance of app. Almost as if it deliberately turns down my data so as not to allow me carryout some functions. Once I'm out of the app, my data network resumes strongly. If I open the app to make transactions, my data network strength disappears and I'm told no network. Easily one of the best Loan Apps. No one sending messages and breathing down your neck. But very unfortunate that after one default they do not give loans any more regardless of how long you never defaulted before. They actually started giving again after a long time. The best in terms of interest and time limit. No annoying calls or threats Borrowed a minimal 6k y'day, repaid with full interest today - no change in available credit status or even a discounted repayment scheme. And the interest was high in my opinion - the likes of FairMoney and QuickCheck are more fair from my experience. Hence, the 1-star.😕 I'll give a 5-star when they improve.. till then✌🏽 Do not trust them!! Not worth!! Always paid in time and before time, however this month my instalments were on 31/1/23, and 1/2/23, i made the the payment yesterday for both the months, however they decreased my limit to 1500/- if you pay before the time they would not value it!! Uninstalling the app!! App is very smooth and easy to use, customer care is very professional and attentive, company is highly professional. If you can build a good credit score with them and overall, you can reach the pick with them. I recommend this for everyone. Interest rate very friendly. Thank you branch. My experience with you guys was awesome. Though I did default to repaying on time due to the fact that I was seriously sick and there was no means to pay up my outstanding loan, though after I got back on my feet I had to redownload the app and repay my debt. You guys are really nice and for the fact that I was offered a 60% discount on the repayment. I'm more than happy and grateful🥲 I'm also looking forward to getting more loan offer and my name being cleard from credit bureau.so it's 5star😍 On the loan section, where there is an option for Aadhaar/Voter ID.. its gets stucked on camera ""Hold Still"". Its just won't respond and the Application gets crashed.. some Bug, Update required.. On the help section, file can't be uploaded, Attack, An error dialogue box pop's up. And Funny part is that, After installing the Application on my device, got a loan offer so i fill up the personal details, bank details and auto debt system, everything done.. No clue what happen where the loan went Branch is a great platform, it helped me at my time of need. I would recommend to anyone who needs a boost when low, the interest rate is quite fair. Though the 23hr limitation before taking another loan after paying a previous one might cause some inconvenience during an emergency. If possible please shorten the duration please, overall the experience is good. Its a good bank I have been with it for a long time,they have a long duration period of paying the loan,low interests,they don't disturb a client asking for payment before the date,they have a wallet so you can save money with them ad also pay your bills using the money in your wallet without transaction fee Branch used to be my favorite, I have been using them for years now, I even rated them 5 starts, but had to come back here to change it to 1 star. Their network is so bad, I had a deposit transaction since 5am yesterday and till today, it has not been updated in my wallet. The sad thing is that I need my money for an emergency. But right now, I am stranded because they have not updated the transfer I made to my wallet. It's saddened!!! The app is a very good one and this is the best experience I ever had regarding loan app in Nigeria. Once I paid up my loan on the due date my chance of getting higher loan was increased immediately. The amazing part is that the loan tenure is very comfortable and the interest rate is very affordable... BRANCH👍👍💯 Best bank I've been using for close to 5 years now. I believe you guys can do better work on the security login page. Instead of typing codes, we could stick to the recent fingerprint scan and more. THANKS! I took loan 9 times, and paid every loan on time, Some times paid a month before due date. But when I tried to apply for a loan again, all of sudden I was not eligible. I do use multiple loan apps but I pay every single amount I take, on time.. Can't say anything bad to branch, as it helped a lot. But I want to know the actual reason, why I was all of sudden not eligible.. Branch is a great online banking option. The services are tailored to suit the needs of customers, and the customer care is prompt, reliable and humane. I have also noticed that their services are improved every time I go online. These are my own observations. But the reason I opened the account is because others recommended it. Now, they have proven that those people were 100% correct. Branch is the next big thing in banking! This app is good for everything, UI and evrything, i will give you 4 rater as you didn't disturbed on weekend. Kindly work on this apart from this, all is good. Apart from this once loan is closed there is no option to generate NOC nor they will send NOC to mail. In CIBIL still it reflects loan ongoing. Need to work on this Branch is a great online banking option. The services are tailored to suit the needs of customers, and the customer care is prompt, reliable and humane. I have also noticed that their services are improved every time I go online. These are my own observations. But the reason I opened the account is because others recommended it. Now, they have proven that those people were 100% correct. Branch is the next big thing in banking! The app is cool it will give u a loan but now the annoying part is that the money will be sent to branch wallet and to withdraw it to mpesa u pay transaction fee which is madness to me. If its not free to transfer to mpesa then why send it to ur branch wallet??? And paying period should start from 30 days going up. Not everyone wants to pay twice. Some of the people can pay once so more options to pay should be there. The best loan app I've used. Very easy and fast🤩 No issues with repayment of loans. Once I transfer it reflects immediately. And I respect Branch for their customer service professionallism in understanding that sometimes customers may not meet the set period of payment due to some challenges. Unlike other apps I've used once your loan is overdue they'll start calling and abusing customers. I get pained whenever they message on WhatsApp calling me different names. But Branch is different. This App is Good, i liked it, but only two things you should update the problems. First one is only 2 months EMI is giving for Loan repayment ,please provide 3 to 5 months atleast to repay Loan Amount easily. Second one is Interest charges are high, reduce some interest charges of Loan , these are the major problems. Kindly please,try to update as soon as possible this problems . Otherwise I will give 5 Stars for this app . Thank you Branch app very good system , gave me loan first 500/- then 1000/- then 1500/- then 4000/- then after re payment gave me direct 8000/- , i like it very much where many times from other loan app With less interest, I hope to take a larger loan in the future 👍I am very happy 😊I have invited many of my friends. Branch is not fake, these days there are many fakes online where the interest rate is much higher than the principal amount, but I did not see anything like that in Branch app. Branch is a excellent loan application. Very user friendly. It's a trusted application. Loan disbursement time is very fast. Everyone can use this application for ful-fill their immediate financial needs. I like this new features, I just updated my app now and I see that the app have been improved, you will now have to put your pin to get access to your account . But I have a suggestion please, if the app is made in such a way that the log in pin is different from your transaction pin it would be great (Suggestion ). App response is fast enough. But the interest charged is stil on the high side. . I have never used any other loan app though, so i can't really compare. I downloaded the app trusting the reviews i got here. And i dont regret it yet. It comes handy when needed. But pls walk on the interest rate, to me its not fair enough. Thanks Your service is great and smooth...I could say it's lovely! The only issue here is that you'll have to improve on the 'loan offers' coz I feel at least if a customer have a good credit history then he/she should be given increased loan offers. In my case, I've always been maintaining a good credit history,yet my offer remains as it has always been. Please work on it. Thanks 😊 I have been using branch since 2019, but in between once my payment was overdue just for 2 days. I missed the payment. And I paid all the dues together on that day. After that am not getting loan from this branch loan app. It was showing like try again after 180days, I have waited for 180days and reapplied today. But still the same. Am an unhappy customer with branch. I was looking loan for medical expense. But still the app gives me disappointment. I would like to rebuild a good relationship. I'm highly disappointed with this app after my awful experience with this app. I did a transaction from my main bank account ( Access Bank) to my branch wallet since on the 16/6/2022 but up to date my wallet has not been credited. I've contacted you people severally via app and email, provided you with the session id, Nip details that I got from my main bank but still yet you people are telling me that you have not received the value of the transaction. It's really annoyancing and frustrating Never ever install this application in your phone. They never send you morethan one sms for your due loan that too in spam folder. If you yourself extend the loan with paying fees they will show that the loan is overdue. They will take the fees and donot extend the loan and once you pay all the balance and close your loan they don't accept your loan and you have to look for other applications. They only make fraud cases and take more charges and extra money. The interest for one month is 300/m Among all the online loan apps, this one is by far the best, i have had used. Unlike other loan apps, who cgarge almost 45% of ur loan amt for processing, this app has a very low & reasonable charges. So the final smount u get is quite good, when compared to any other. Overall can say, this app is the most genuine loan app, that exists at Play Store. Good & fast service. Keep up the good work. Cheers It is a genuine app. 100% trustable app. I am using 2 year running. But I faced some issues like , last loan was 17500 rupees but after repayment on time also decreased the loan limit this time. After payment done before the due date or on the date also not increase my credit limit. Kindly look into the matter. Thanks. Very disappointing App, I tried funding my wallet, the money reflected, suddenly it bounced back to the account I transferred from, since then I can't find my wallet. Contacted the customer care, they simply told me to exercise patience, three days no response from them, when I chat them again, they still tell me to patience. This is very disappointing. This is literally the best loan app. The awesome thing about Branch is that they don't threaten you like other loan apps out there. I've deleted other loan apps from my device. If your payment is due, they'll send you a prompt via the app. Their interest rates are okay and the duration is good. They also have excellent saving plans. Branch to the world!!! Got an loan of Rs1500 (1348 after processing fee etc. deduction) instantly even on Sunday .....make sure to upload the docs and fill your info correctly .....l gone through some other apps but I found this one is having lowest processing fees and easy to operate. However they don't give you big amount upfront, they increase the loan eligibility gradually after your repayment. I think this is a handy app if you stuck somewhere and need some cash. This is very disappointing and frustrating app. So I have taken a loan since last almost a year and paying a regular payment on time even in advance. But to my surprise they have some pathetic system which decide your eligibility basis on your timely payment. First they reduce my limit then now this month I have paid the loan in full and guess what I am not meeting there criteria for new loan and my application has been rejected...great job...will not recommend to anyone to go with this app... It's the best app I have used in last 2 months. Their interest rates is very low and tenure also 31 to 62 days . But I have one query, i made my first repayment on time still my loan offer are closed and app shows try after 180 days. I dont know that is glitch or something else. Please help me.i don't know what to do. This app is somehow stressing,you have locked my account no communication and am in need of that money,the app is going down, upgrade and try to be frank,loan is also not responding,they said I can apply after 90 days,and I waited for the period to be over. after that they tell me to apply again in 7 days, that was not the conditions I read before. I can only give you 2 Stars for the rating till you work on those things.",support,branch.co,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,control vibration draw over other apps full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,1

But there is two thing I would really like to see in upcoming updates. Better voice control (I'm listening to loads of music in my car and hands free control is rather crucial) and marking songs to play next. Kudos to developer you doing briliant job. Edit: just figured out how queue works, briliant feature Edited : I took a loan from this app and paid on time every time .. and now when I need the money after a month or so they cancelled the request !! BAD experience .. !! All depends on credit score , if you don't have a good credit score you will get nothing 😕 ... totally useless .. :- uninstalled I would have given 5 stars. Due to logic less companies policy have given 3. I have closed the loan before the due date. My top-up loan amount also increased. Have applied for the same today but declined. I don't understand the so called policy.. Still I'm getting notification n messages shows that my loan is ready.. i hope this is the end of the journey with True balance. worst app they don't show how much interest they will charge. they take so much money upfront 11% for the upfront payment. and the ROI is above 200% per annum. which is ridiculous. when you go and visit. they don't show much information. they just shows that the interest will be from so to so. but after they take the data they just directly pay to your back. and there is no connection btw the customer care numbers. they never get connected. I tried so hard to resend the money back. wrost app I hope believe me really happy download know real application This is a great app!

I disc Worst app of all for loan application they don't show interest rate properly and suddenly disburse money in the bank account after that I found out that the rate of interest is about 200% which is unbelievably high.I have to pay 21000 for 13000rs disbursal amount for a 6month tenure. I will not refer this app to anyone and I seriously done with it... One week before, i got approved a cash loan. At the time of disbursement, I have noticed that a wrong bank account number has been mentioned and I immediately contacted your customer service. But their response was very poor and asked me to wait for one month (in a harsh language). Further I sent some emails to you and your office asked me to reapply the same loan. Accordingly, I again re-applied for a cash loan and it got approved. But, again my account no is wrong. Nobody is ready to help I have paid EMI through cred app and money deducted from my bank account and the status in cred app showing as successful but it is not reflecting in the true balance app. Worst app. When I try to send an email regarding this issue, I'm unable to send it. Very worst app. I recharge but my money cut but not show successful recharge. Then I recharge through airtel thanks app. Then it show recharge successful. Double recharge done because of this worst app. I mail trueblace customer service but not reply from them. I want my money back I really sad about this application. I read many reviews and i believed this app is true. But When i tried this, it's only shows under processing till aftrer 24 hours now.they say they will contact me soon, but i don't get any call. Then i try to contact through mail, they responded that they will contact soon.i just want to know know if it rejected on processing. It's bad experience for me. The app say loan take place within 5 minutes, but for me iam really sad abou this. Worst app I had seen , I had downloaded this and done all payment before due dates Whenever I had loan from it . Now i had Full Payment with interest whatever they charged. Now the system is showing the service is stop and will let u know if Resume. They are just neglecteling customer after some days . The notification in app itself coming tha Level Up your loan and get higher loan amount. Now i had paid it they just stopped my service, Asking customer care people they are saying we don't know. Don't take it..I applied for the loan..but I didn't get the cash. The approved message came and the application was blocked saying that the bank and PAN card do not match. But now I can't even delete the account. Emi also says to pay from next month.. I am using true balance from last 3 months its been a great app . But recently I am in urgent need of loan and I have applied for loan but my application is stuck on evaluation. I have emailed as well but no response and also called customer care but not that useful. I am in urgent need and I have first time got such experience with true balance there is no option to describe or give negative star option that's why I gave stat for this app.Worst experience. time sucking app. From this App received message again and again to apply for a loan but the fact is I tried more than five times .every time they took 3 to 4 days and then they send a message as your application was withdrawan you can reapply anytime. Don't waste our time . Worst experience ever had in a financing platform, they looting a huge amount from the approved credit limit to the cash Disbursed into your account for me they approved 23000/- and the Disbursal amount is 16000/- they are looting 7000/- initially apart from the monthly EMI also they won't show the total amount approved and EMI amount to be paid monthly they will only show the amount to be Disbursed after all deductions to be Frank they are STEALING huge amount without any hesitation CHEATERS!! I am very disappointed with this app, because it has froud, because I got the limit for the first time and I also used it, and paid it after ten days, then the second time when I got the limit Regretted for a month, totally fraud Wrost app Money deducted from truebalance app but I didn't got the recharge confirmation from my operator. I contacted to the customer service but they are saying recharge was successful from there side but when I contacted My operator customer service they said they haven't got any recharge.... This app is fraud. They send messages that your amount is disbursed but same don't get credited in the account. If we call on customer care then they advice to e mail as they don't have any solution.. If we then mail.them then they do not even reply even after sending reminders. Very nice & authentic app.. Amount was Disbursed within a minute. So nice service. But one thing disappointed me that Rate of interest very high & repayment time period also low .. I hope such issue will be resolved soon. Upfated review - loan aplication has been rejected after 10days of applied. Reason bank details & pan details notatch. But every time same accound & same pan no. I hot loan. This time rejected because i apply for low rate loan. But they dont provide low rate loan just doing time pass & west of time. I suggest every one you should go for other better app for loan. Experiance not good so i change my review & change my rating also. 👎🏻 Nice app. Process and sanction loan fast. But rate of interest is high and tenure is small. Rate of interest should be reduced for regularly paying customer and tenure should be extended. Hello, I have applied for a loan of Rs 20000, but the amount has not yet been credited to my account though it is showing in the app that the amount has been disbursed to my account. Please look into this matter immediately or I shall be bound to lodge a complaint to consumer forum. I have also mailed the team twice, by getting no reply I came here to let everyone know about it. Please transfer the money immediately to my account else remove it from the app because I haven't received money yet Don't go for it, it's a very worst and dangerous app, and even if you pay all the payments on ontime or before the due date they will reject your next loan applications, the rejections are different and higher amounts of loans that u haven't applied, also the interest rates at high only 75% of loan amount only credited for a loan, they charge remaining as processing charges, loan rejections and enquires also reflects as negative in cibil....... It's not a true balance, it's a false balance..... Disappointed Have been using this app for last 6months I closed a loan of 12000 And I was going to apply for new loan Suddenly I can't login to my app and it's showing, temporarily blocked due to wrong OTP...and wait for 1 day and it's been 2 days I can't login to my account and when I contact customer care they're not giving me proper answer someone telling 15 days someone telling 3 days.... I don't what they're saying... Very disappointed Worst app have ever seen, I am platinum customer as per they says, had taken loan sevaral time, paid each of them few days before due date, but when now apply for new, taking more that 24 hrs , withdrawn the application and reject it. I suggest not to use this any more. Such an awesome and genuine platform for loan seriously i used lots of application before truebalance even i also used rupeeredee before this app rupeeredee stands no where front of their service such an awesome application thank you for creating such an outstanding application and thanks to playstore who allow this kind of genuine loan app... just go and try true balance pay your due on time seriously you will see best result which you definitely never see in other apps that is my guarantee.... Worst app I ever seen . Even I pay entire due in single payment it rejected my loan showing try again after 30 days . It saying you are not eligible if I am not eligible how did true balance gave me loan earlier that too 2times This time this app is creating problem, every time we are getting message, your loan is approved, just click this one, when we click, show only window, no click event on this window, I call to customer care, but not getting any response, I have raised ticket also, Application is good faster processing but customer service is too bad... I opened a loan and closed it with late fee i get the NOC & all clearence from the application but in my cibil score there is no change in this so plz check while closing or opening the loan i try too many times to contact the customer service but there is no valuable reply from the app side so take care .Worst application Almost last one year i am using true balance account, last time i will close my loan and delete my account. After 2 days check back my true balance account, the application shown as please check after one month, after one month check my true balance account it shows please enter my pan card number for kyc procedure, after entering my pan card number the application shows, you are already completed with us, please active my account. After 120 days my account not active Hey..I have always repaid the emis on time..Today I cleared it before my due date and when I tried to apply again it's showing me that the disbursal has been paused..There are so many people who have faced the same issue..So you can't give the same explanation to everyone..There is no time frame mentioned..it just says 10 am..Make sure that it works tomorrow or else have to rate your app badly and my friends too who are facing the same issue will retort. Kindly make sure that it works tomorrow Very very bad app. Because i always paid before due date. Most of the time i paid before a month. But always evaluvate stupidly always reject my loan. It is one of the worst and cheating customers platform. Don't trust this platform ever. They won't give proper response and answer to the customer if we ask anything regarding our application simply they ignore our call directly. So my humble request to one and all dont trust this platform. I have mailed them several times about my concern but still no response from there side. Application shows "" You got an answer from customer care "" but Its not even open. why they are sending response in applications over and over again knowing that I am unable to open it up. I am editing my score to 2 stars from 4 because I used true balance from last 3 years and never missed 1 payment and paid before payment date and when I need I am taking for some purchases. But November I tried to apply for levelup loan it showed processing but they called for confirmation I don't know that I was busy didn't pick call for only that reason still I am not approved loan even my sore is good and no miss paytm in total credit history. Im a good customer i pay all emi's before due date when I applied for level up loan they said me wait for verification call seriously?? There is no verification needed in level up loans but here they cheat you and lie worst app i thought true balance is one of the best app and give loans quick...this app doesn't deserve a single star if there a option of 0 star i would rated 0 for this worst app and yes they show the emi tenure to select by customer but there is nothing like that..worst app I will give this app one star. They deserve this every single day they send message that your loan is approved when I login to app and process everytime they say your loan is not approved and send message almost every alternate day your loan is approved.Everytime app says apply after 30 days although my cibil score is good. I have taken loan 3-4 times and always paid before due date. I tried to take another loan system says you are not qualified try after 30 days. Customer support is completely unprofessional when I have called them regarding my concern that my loan has been approved but disbursement not happend yet and you guys started interest rate on the amount loan applied and most of the time your application doesn't work properly. No, use of using this app. for loan. Approved loan on 1st Jan 2023. But still now disbursement not happened. But their reply, disbursement done and the emi start from 10th Feb 2023. Send lot of mails and received only auto acknowledgment. May be they are cheating and do 420 job to the customers. Very fed-up. Even for this message they say send screenshot of the error and to their mail ID. They never solve the problem. Request you to tell just yes or no.

Agyathuri, Chamajali, Amingaon Guwahati Kamrup, Assam 781031",4.3461556,204806,"I promptly paid all of my loan obligations, but my re-loan application remained pending for more than 3 days. I was unable to contact the support team when they promised to transfer the funds if my loan was approved within 24 hours, but my account has yet to be credited, and the app once more displays ""application under review.""  I'm absolutely lost and don't know what to do.  😞😞😞 Applied for the loan and submitted all the necessary documents for the same. The loan is sanctioned and the repayment date is shown but the amount sanctioned is not yet disbursed. I do not wish to continue with this loan and wpuld like to cancel it but there is no option to do so. It is very poor service from your end. I fear for the details shared with your application. Worst experience which i had. I had taken loan three times till now and i have made a payment on time without any delay. Every time the limit used to increase automatically but this time my limit has been decreased automatically even after making on time payment before the due date. I am trying to reach out customer care but no response from them. What is the point of making a payment on time if credit limit is not increased. Or at least i should get the same credit limit which I was having befo The due date should be when you transfer the amount to the bank account but in this app they will put the due date when you apply for loan. I didn't even got the money and the status shows auditing but it shows my due date without even lending me the money. I think it's fake app If u pay on time ur limit will increase but there one demerit that they provide loan with very high interest rate. If they provide loan with low interest then I think it is best app for short time loan and for emergency. Such a phytic app to get loan,the interest rate is very high 40 to 45% all the executives are chapri kind of people, they will irritate you by calling several times, if you fail to answer they take out pictures from gallery and pull out the contact from your phone book and Start texting (text with lots of abusive words) and calling them on their what's app, I recommendation never ever go fo this Very very bad loan application it's not an emergency loan application it's just play with our needs , waiting a lots and pay more for them ,guys don't waste your time take loan from this app try any other .this app was waste yours time really.dissappointed they not always confirmed by 24hours approved or not they also not sure and suddenly said audit failed always guys don't tryto time waste . Good I have just used it but processing fee and interest is very high..got a meager amount...the customer care executive said process fee will not be there for the next time once I clear my dues and the credit limit will also increase..let's see I have a credit limit of 2000 but not able to get loan its showing error on login number and addhar mobile number is different.but my both number or same.I am trying to call customer care but its not connecting waste of time on applying this don't download and don't waste time I am not sure what to write over here I applied for a small loan of 2500 and after so many deduction in the name of service charge and GST and other stuff - now they are reviewing the application since 2 hrs and there is already EMi date updated on the app but there is no disbursement of money and they have taken all the documents as well Now I don't know where are my documents and they are secure or not I have emailed them called them no one bother to respond This is really frustrating This app is doing very fine to their customers 😂. 1st point - They give me some money on my emergency basis on very high charges but that's okay bcz I need that money. 2nd point - they calling & messaging me on whatsapp & number to pay the due amount before the due date & harrassing & threatening. 3rd point - I've mailed several times to point out my issues they just replied ""It's just reminder for your payment incase you didn't miss the pymnt"" 4th point - I'm gonna mke the pymnt & file cmplnt I don't know what rating they deserve, there are due date shown ,but there is no distribution of money...I requesting to the owner of the app. Either, distribute the loan properly, or do not accept the loan requests. Very worst application. I can't get any amount in my bank. But they call and message me to paid the loan amount. Pay Rupik online app is not providing the loans time waste app,, just they are sending many more messages 10000 activated in our system instant approval please visit to the link after visit the link its show file rejected,,, why you people are sending that kind of messages,,, time waste app guys from past 1 month iam trying... 👎👎 No option that's why i given single star Friends Don't download. They will not increase your credit limit after every repayment. And intrest is very high please don't take loan in this app this is my experience. Don't take loan from this application Loan is given only for 14 days in this application When the loan amount is due, the company recovery agent does harassment every day. By calling continuously and they have our contact list, in that they threaten to call. Totally Frude application I have applied for a small loan and I got approved also after submitting all the documents only I got approved for my loan but till now I haven't received any amount! Very disappointing December 30 , 2022 The due date should be when you transfer the amount to the bank account but in this app they will put the due date when you apply for loan. I didn't even got the money and the status shows auditing but it shows my due date without even lending me the money. I think it's fake app Thank you for getting me out of a difficult financial situation. Very good app for emergency financial needs. I got a loan in 1 hr. Interest rates are comperativly low than other apps. Quick disbursal of loan amounts. Useful app Whenever I applied for the loan. It's redirecting me to back to homepage i cannot be able to apply. Then i decided to talk with the customer service they also not giving any messages reply i have a really very worst experience with this app please resolve my problem. Third class app. Don't install this app two times applied for loan they rejected both times without any reasons. Zero customer support totally useless app. Just taking our important documents like aadhar and pan card. Again saying don't install this app. I was using from last 7 days totally fail app. 🙏 Very bad experience only messaging for apply for a loan but when I applied it was reject again and again.. several times rejection not recommend to anyone very bad very bad experience giving only 2000 and that also rejected only data collecting app.. don't download this... The loan is approved but not disbursed yet,as the loan status is showing under review from past 48 hours tried to call the customer care and some women picked up the phone,and asked for my registered number and told me due to some technical glitch loan is not disbursed and disconnected the call without my consent very bad service. They charge too much service charge. 45 days loan. Before due date they start harassing. Within 2 days i recieved 8 calls for payment and 72 missed calls. I have taken 5 times loan, never missed any emi. Payed on or before due date. But today they irritated me so much. I already paid the amount. My next amount already recommended but i am not getting OTP since yesterday. I already mailed u but there is no response, just say that we have sent the OTP . I m getting frustrated It would be a 5star rated app. Its a great app for loans. But the only problem is their customer service. The people will call you every hour to make the payments 2days prior to the due date. And thret you to lower your CIBIL. The app is 5star. But beware of the customer service. Worst app, don't download and request for money. I requested but not dibursed till now and no option for cancel. I fear that I privacy inf. With payrupik😢. Customer and helpline no. are also unavailable. Very fraud app, I have been trying for a long time. Nothing is being received, loan is not available. Brother, don't try any one, it is useless, it takes the document and nothing else Worst experience which i had. I had taken loan three times till now and i have made a payment on time without any delay. Every time the limit used to increase automatically but this time my limit has been decreased automatically even after making on time payment before the due date. I am trying to reach out customer care but no response from them. What is the point of making a payment on time if credit limit is not increased. Or at least i should get the same credit limit which I was having befo They had been calling me and sending messages again and again till I repay my due. They don't even reply for my message after the repayment and still shows in app that I didn't repay the due. This is absolutely cheating. If there is any option to upload fotos, I could have uploaded all the evidences (screenshots) of their scam. I think most of the good ratings are done by paid scammers. I sincerely recommend everyone please don't even install this application 🙏🏻 Very helpful plateform I experience at tht time yet.they help me in my difficult situations...Only one little bug they need to working on this,they give time of repayments only some days. Good experience so far. They are quite quick on application processing. As I did instant repayment today only on the last day they offered me my next limit almost double. Only two things needed to be work out I would say 1. The tenure period of repayment is too short and 2. The processing fee, intrest and then intrest is little higer which I think can be worked out. Else I would surely recommend PayRupik if you looking for instance small credits. Great experience no hassle at all. Quick n easy process. Anyone who is looking for a small loan for short term should use this application. Took a bit of time like 18 hours to processing but once its approved you get your noney in account in 5 minutes good service but they need to raise the limit they gave me 1800 limit what should i do with it its useless limit but whatever they give me it was quick so i enjoyed it It's a useless app, fraud don't download and waste your time, instead of you can try capitalnow or branch for quick loan disbursement with less documents. Before due date they force to pay emi. Its been 4 5 times i have taken loan and paid it on time. This time they crossed limit since yesterday they ve been continuously texting on whtassap and forcing to pay I will pay but never take loan again from this app Never take any loan from them.. Charges are too high and within a month you have to pay high ammount but after reapply you will get smaller amount Good App, Fast disbursement. But offered loan amount is very small. And repayment tenure also very short for 7 days. Pathetic experience with this app. I applied 2 times. On screen it shows verify and process takes 24 hrs. And then rejected.. why are you operating this app. On app it seems loan in 1 hr takes 24 and and loan not be given... I do not recommend to anyone. Vogus app. Doesnt disburse anything. Only collects personal data. And lots of spam calls are coming.",service,payrupikloan.in,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,create accounts and set passwords full network access measure app storage space prevent device from sleeping view network connections receive data from Internet update component usage statistics,0

Continuous use can increase the user's loan limit.
The loan amount, interest rate, and loan time are subject to actual review.",4.364706,15756,"Amount showing disbursed but not credited in account. Amount disbursed account number showing is wrong that is auto picked by app. Status showing as repayment pending. No customer care number, mail id to reach out to. Everything is nice but the repayment policy... It sucks! My repayment date was 8th but suddenly on 7th morning they start calling & messaging for the same..when i conveyed that i can pay by the end of the day they start abusing me & threat me to publize all my data.. This really difficult to manage this i am trying to repayment this blink loan app but it is showing system error again today date is 28/12/22 Wednesday ,if the amount is not paid on time due to system error then any legal proceedings will be by lawyer. The app isn't working properly and not even checking and UPI I'd or any other facility to pay amount and before the time it is showing rollover payment that to presently not needed,it's unfair and no proper customer service from this app. I personally really like this application. Honestly, I think I'm new to this BlinkLoan application, I just found a feature in the form of timely repayment that can increase the amount / reduce interest, I like this application Indeed, if there is quality, there will always be a breakthrough that makes people like it, especially if it is very consistent. I am really amazed by the BlinkLoan application which has very patient and kind customer service, helping me solve any financial problems. As long as they can guarantee with certainty to protect my privacy, I will always trust the BlinkLoan application. Because for now I rarely see any application that guarantees high. Thank you for being different. When I first found out about this application from a friend, at first I half believed it and didn't. Because I've also experienced applications similar to BlinkLoan and it wasn't worth it at all. Then finally with a heavy heart I tried eh now it's been 6 months and it's still reliable There's a lot of evidence that every time they make a loan in BlinkLoan they always pass, even though I think it's really easy and they don't know that this BlinkLoan application has a high pass rate that is easy to use too The few steps I have to apply for a loan, it's even better. Because with fewer steps there will be less information to fill when using the BlinkLoan application. It's a great application. Indeed, at first I knew this application from friends and indeed many of my relatives were using this BlinkLoan application. Ahh at first I didn't believe it, I was afraid that it was actually a high risk nowadays, but it turned out to be very helpful It turns out that it's easy and easy, if you want the loan interest to be reduced, I just found out that timely repayment can reduce interest, I like this Blinkloan application, it helps me who wants the loan interest to be reduced In my opinion, repayments that do not need to be confused, because this is in the BlinkLoan application, it turns out that the repayment time can be delayed which is of course very helpful because you have not been able to repay the loan Duh, it seems like it's not old enough nowadays that people are still confused and don't know how to use this BlinkLoan application. The thing is, yes, it is equipped with features that are simple and easy to understand, this is very helpful for me Surely you will smile if you see one of the advantages of this BlinkLoan application. Yups, of course and it's true that the repayment time can be delayed. Hayoo must be drooling and curious right, let's try it together Duh, I'm really dizzy thinking about this, where is the BlinkLoan app taking advantage of? All benefits are given to customers, for example, timely repayment can reduce interest, I like this application, no need to ask, thank you The problem is only this Blinkloan application that can make me satisfied with its features, because other applications have not been able to become like this, I give the best loan title to this application because with its simple and easy-to-understand features, this really helps me OMG, why is this application BlinkLoan rarely talked about by people, even though I knew it from the start and saw it was very interesting. Few steps, simple application, less steps, less information to fill You don't have to bother, let alone get dizzy, it's the same as the steps in the process of making a loan, because in this BlinkLoan application, there are a few steps, a simple application, fewer steps, less information to fill out I no longer need to be complicated with many steps like in my previous loan application, because in this BlinkLoan application, it only provides a few steps, a simple application, fewer steps, less information to fill out Don't worry, everybody nowadays, you don't have to worry about things that are not clear. Like worrying about not being accepted because of complicated loan terms and conditions. So if BlinkLoan has a high pass rate, it's safe There are so many things that must be delicious for us as customers. An example of one of them is that it turns out that if you pay off on time you can reduce interest, I like this BlinkLoan application, thank you The loan in the BlinkLoan application really needs to be appreciated as high as possible, guys. It's not easy, there are applications that want to provide fast loans. It's only in this application. The customer service in the BlinkLoan app is really cool, guys. It's been very patient for those who still don't understand the application, and it's very good too. I'm sure this app will help solve my problem. I used to really regret why I didn't try the loan application from a long time ago, because only here I just found out about the loan process with a few steps, a simple application, fewer steps, less information to fill out. Thanks BlinkLoan I swear, this BlinkLoan application is really already considered my friend and bestie. The customer service was very patient, helpful and helped me solve problems. Genuine excellent customer service Where else do you think about making a loan as fast as lightning if not in this BlinkLoan application. I've tried several applications from previous years, so far I think this is the fastest loan application The money was easily received in my account thanks to the loan which was really fast and didn't make me bored to wait. The real BlinkLoan app is really helpful. I hope that it will continue like this in the future. This application is really a winner BlinkLoan. It's not easy, they consistently provide the best service and are able to protect the privacy of users, including myself. Thank you very much for the help. I've done the loan several times and I was able to pass the loan thanks to the high pass rate that can only be experienced by this BlinkLoan application, thank you very much for being very helpful In the beginning, why was I able to download this application, I knew this application from friends/relatives, then after a long time, many people started to use it. So finally I really tried to download BlinkLoan, it really helped Where else does Gaksie bestie get to know this super duper royal application like BlinkLoan. Yes, he provides conditions for timely repayment can increase the amount and also reduce interest, I like this application The feature problem for me this BlinkLoan application is no problem and I didn't find any problems, with its simple and easy-to-understand features, this really helped me in applying for the loan I wanted. I'm afraid the disbursement will take a long time even though I still need it and fortunately this BlinkLoan application is able to provide faster disbursement than loan applications in general so that the money has been received by me and I can use it now Trying to use other loan applications but unlike this BlinkLoan application which gave me a loan with a few steps, a simple application, fewer steps, less information to fill out, so I'm not too sure about other loan applications It's so easy to make a loan on this BlinkLoan application because the repayment time can be delayed which I've tried to use and of course this makes it very easy and very helpful for me woww the BlinkLoan application can now be paid in installments, I was very helpful in making the existing payments, thank you very much, BlinkLoan for providing features, everything works very well, always great Anyway, I want to give a lot of hope for a very very useful application like BlinkLoan. One of my many hopes is that I hope to increase the width of the capital and loan cycle. will definitely always recommend the BlinkLoan app to my friends. Because there are still many of my friends who need loan funds immediately. Thank you very much for helping my finances too. The first time I made a loan on this BlinkLoan application, I was just confused when I couldn't repay the loan and my friend told me to try to apply for the repayment time, it could be delayed on this BlinkLoan application and it worked I guess I don't need to be afraid if I want to apply for a loan on one of these Indian Rupee lending platforms. The BlinkLoan application is able to provide many channels, and is an online loan software that can take short-term loans.",dahskj435ew,gmail.com,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,access Bluetooth settings connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi control vibration full network access pair with Bluetooth devices prevent device from sleeping view network connections receive data from Internet,1

Download the FairMoney App today!",3.5291035,551629,"This app is a very good loan app and the experience of transactions on it has been amazing so far. The issues I have with this app is just that someone used my card to get a loan and since then, I've not been able to get a loan for myself even after the loan was paid. Another one is that, on my app I can't apply for a debit card and it's really frustrating cos I have to do a transfer to do withdrawal. Apart from these things, the app is doing a rendering good services. This is one of the most frustrating app in the world, if you have emergency and decide to recharge or buy data using the app, you're finished. You forgot your password and click on ""forgot password"" option, it will still ask you to enter. You want to add your card, after entering card details, it will ask to close page in order to continue but there is no provision to close page. If you click back, it will take you to the process afresh. The app have design defficiencies. The platform saved me when I needed to augment some stuffs but fumbled at a critical stage when it asked me to link my card. I've been keeping a good record of repayment before the due dates without using card as my repayment method. This last experience is the worst compared to the previous experiences put together. There should be other options aside adding debit cards. The service is fairly good but needs improvement. The loan app is the best loan app I've seen so far. Once you pay early, they increase your loan amount and also the interest is reduced too. But my last experience was no fun at all. After repaying all the money that I should have actually paid in two months in less than a month. My loan amount was totally reduced instead of increasing it and the interest rate was high. Pls do something about it Very good and timely App but, the interest rate should be reviewed downward to make repaymment easy on such soft loan. The disappointing thing about the App was instead of upward loan increase , it will decreased by almost half of what was previously approved even when you paid on time (=N=90,000:00k was approved & after I paid on time & reapplied it was cut to =N=64,000). Right now, am thinking of uninstalling it from my phone to give way for better Apps with better offers. Very bad experience. So far, my experience with this app has been wonderful! I love the fairlock & fairsave features particularly because they give much better interest rate on savings & fixed savings. I also love the discount on most purchases done with the app. I highly recommend it. I gave you 5 stars bcos in term of loans, you are doing well. However, I still take stance of other services! sometimes, the pending in transfers takes so long, even airtime purchases. You also need to update include sport betting direct deposit from you app. Hopefully this review will be useful to you guys, you should update your app, allow direct deposit via added debit card, while fairmoney account number is meant for receiving money from other bank accounts. Amazing financial saver. But the way you people usually call with different numbers when repayment is due is poor. Different phone number will be calling and calling. One thing fof sure is that; the payment will surely be balanced. But work on the aspect of using different numbers to call. You can be using normal phone number to call. But the app is really fair just like the name 👏 This loan app is far the best because it has features which other doesn't have especially the loan extension. If you had challenges in repaying you can extend to the future. I highly recommend this loan app. I have been using loan app for the past three years but I didn't know there is one like Fairmoney. Thanks for the distinct feature. Kudos. The loan rate is ok given the tenure to pay back, which make it very competitive. However, after repaying my first loan, I've had difficulty in taking another, given that I can't complete my card binding, a fault I don't know if it from paystack or from your end. After inputing otp and deducted, a ""close this page to continue"" shows, but there's no icon to click to close page, and if I use the ""back button"" on my phone, it shows abandoned.... pls fix this so I can bind my card. Thank you Up until now I'd say good services The Save features, loans, free transfers and all others My lil issue is with the Loans and app interface The Loans come with exorbitant interest rates The app interface seems a bit dated it needs a little touch up and a fingerprint or face-Id integration too for ease of access. Good job tho ; ) If you need a loan that would arrive at the speed of lightning, then FairMoney is the app. However, they didn't give me the exact amount I wanted, due to it was my first time, plus their interest rate is a tiny winny bit high. However, they are good overall. Everything else was Okay honestly asides the fact that I tried taking a loan and tried connecting my card at the end but then I can't.. I use a UBA card and when I try connecting it take me to a UBA authorisations page and when it says close this page to continue.. there's no follow up button to close the page.. when I just click on my back navigation button it takes me to the beginning and I have to repeat all process without progress.. the card system is broken I have been using this app satisfactorily for years. Suddenly, I cannot access loans because your app says my card is tied to an existing loan, which isn't true, as I have paid off all loans without defaulting. None of your contact agents have been able to resolve this issue for over two weeks. This app is wonderful; the customercare very reliable. Although I wasn't offered up to 5% of the amount I requested, I'm confident with the services. You are given the terms and conditions that help you get what you want when you comply and these are favourable. They have several other ways of helping customers grow their money. Their method of repayment is just okay. Infact, I am at ease with fair money! I recommend it to all honest loan applicants. Genuine, reliable. It rescue me from emergency need of money. Have been using for more than a year. If you pay early your interest reduce and they increase your loan rate . The only loan app I can trust. But I advice you collect the loan amount you can easily pay back. For me I don't collect more than 20k 😆 It's already more than a month completed and the app shows your money is on the way, worst experience ever, your support team said that the loan gets cancelled after Two weeks and after that I can reapply for the loan, now it's more than a month and the app still shows that the loan is on the way. Such a ridiculous customer support. Why do you lie to your customers, be sure before conveying any information, very much disappointing. I cannot login and access my funds. I'm asked to upload a selfie and immediately after that, the app crashes. I've been trying to login for a week now. Continues to crash. I need to access my funds. Re: I'm using the most recent update and I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I collected loan and paid after using it almost immediately. Something came up and needed the same loan. Applied and was given same amount as previous with a higher interest rate. No increase in next loan amount after early payment, no reduction in interest rate. This is really absurd, what would have gone wrong with your service? I have so much love the app, easy access to your funds, loan paying of electricity bill became more easier for me. But this last experience has been frustrating me, for about a week now, I was unable to login into my account just asking me for location permission, and all permissions for this app has been allowed. I'm really frustrated, to send money now is becoming difficult. I'm even planning to register on another bank. Pls🙏🙏 do something to this problems. This app is wonderful, the customer care very reliable although i wasn't offered up to 5% of the amount i requested, I'm confident with the services. Their are given the terms and conditions that help you get what you want when you comply and these are favourable. The have sereral other ways of helping customers grow their are money. Their method of repayment is just okay, infact, I'm at ease with faimoney! I recommend it to all honest loan applicants. 💕 This app is truly out of this world; it is the epitome of overpowered apps. It is exceptionally a one-of-a-kind app so much so that: 1) it forgets your PIN after every use(you'll have reset it on each use) 2) it gives you no way to delete your account (or data) in-app 3) it asks for every sensitive personal information (and gets them, or you can't borrow) Only a great app can do that. :) The app has been so useful for me especially the free transfer I enjoy every month. But it would have been so good if the app can be designed to all users access their accounts statements on the app so as to make personal issues one may encounter while using the app faster to be resolved. well, the fair money app is a good recommendation for anyone who wants to use the app to gain insight into the workings of the financial institution. For me it is a good experience getting a loan and paying it off. As a finance student with MITx and the finance institute, I can have an experience to share while writing my papers. Very bad app, I have paid the money into their wallet but they keep on deducting from my bank account, I will send them email but they will not respond and still keep deducting from my bank account. I advise anyone not to use them, even extension is not working and I am regretting using them now. I will stop putting money into that account so that they cannot be withdrawing my money. Firstly, I'm really enjoying the investment banking with you. Honestly, it's very interesting. Secondly, I'm not really satisfied with the loan offer To me, it's very very poor(far beyond my expectations) . Aside this, they are sure to go. I can conveniently invite my friends to try this out. The interest rate is cool/OK. The loan app is the best just that the rate is high, but easy to access incase of challenges in paying back, i want them to work on the rate then instead of taking the extention for nothing, let them be deducting every extension fee paid from the outstanding loan, so the outstanding money can be reducing.please. This app is great and convenient to use, but im facing some challenges on my account, first, i was told that i need to contact customer care in order to complete my registration, secondly, i tried to transfer money from my account to opay account but i couldn't see opay from the bank list. Thirdly, I couldn't see fairlock and fare save on my app. Last, how do i get loan upto 1 or 2 million naira on fair money app. Thanks Ismaheel Jimoh Very disappointed I must say. After almost a year with this app with a good credit score - never defaulted, I still get a very low loan offer. I thought they could really help with a good smes loan for business but sadly they are like the rest of them. Very disappointed. From repaying 120k loan to going back to bin offer 60k. What rubbish. Please take the offer - I don't need it. Fair Money is always my best loan app Infact I prefer Fairmoney to most banks This is because of my experience with their services. Paying of bills are easy, Recharging your phone is very fast, and other services. Most of them all is their loan network: it's fast and reliable. Within 3 minutes you're credited already. The loan review process was pretty straightforward, the loan came in handy and the repayment intervals fair, like their name says. However, unlike the 30% interest used in their example for borrowing N100k, i was charged close to 70% for N50k, for three months! My people, huzzle oooo, make your own good money. Cost of funds is too high. This is definitely one of the best loan apps I've ever come across. I think it's only Palmpay that can match these authenticatic transaction of fairMoney app. I gave 4 stars because the interest rate is just too ridiculous, 20% for two weeks & 30% for a month. It will be good if you guys can find modalities around reduction of the interest rate, Thanks 👍 The app new update is currently giving me issues. I can no longer login. I have an unpaid debt to settle but the app is not responding whenever I login my four digits number. They keep sending me OTP over and over again. They said I've logged out and i should login again. Please, I need help I want to pay my debt before the due date. Thanks. Yeah, as much as the app has been very helpful, the interest rate is too high and exploiting. I wonder what building good credit score is all about, without positively influencing the interest rate. I have been using this app for years and I have no problem with the service but the constant calling 10 days before the due date is what I don't like. My top 5 loan apps you're the last because of this issue of constant calling and I have decided not to be paying on time till the last day. Disturbing me at my working place is what I cannot take. I have never owe nor miss a month without sending money into your account for years now. You guys have been good but recently i was disapointed.. The system automatically put a fix loan amount of 2.5million. Which is too high for me.. I need options to choose from. I called and complained to customer care for days now.. But nothing is done to change it.. I am financially down at the moment.. Fairmoney loan app use to be my saving grace.. I make repayment before due date so why are you frustrating my effort.. Even your customer care cannot fix it. This is a great app. Well design app with a friendly interface and simplicity. I could not believe that an app could be this awesome. The process was smooth. Once you have all the correct information needed, your application will be processed in minutes. The interest rate though is high. I would have given 5 stars but no. I've gotten my Fairmoney ATM card and I've been using it since last year, did over N50,000 transactions on it but I applied for a loan today just to see a notification that I can't be offered a loan and that I'm not using Fairmoney very well; which is not true. Kindly help resolve that as soon as possible. This is really disappointing, I made a transaction today through a POS which was deducted from my account but was declined at the POS counter. Thought would be reversed within few minutes but no. It's been more than 1 hour now haven't seen the money been reversed. Since almost a month now have not gotten any information about this debit. This app has been the best loan app but recently when I tried to pay for an extension on my loan, the money was debited but never reflected on the app. I sent them a mail for over two weeks now they keep calling me to make payments and when I try to do that I get am error message saying I have pending payment request. So now the have accumulated charges for me to pay and I can't still pay...

After paying all the dues on time without fail, when applied for the second time with good CIBIL. The charges are high when compared to other Apps. They don't value existing customers. No response to emails. Very poor customer service. No way you can reach them by phone calls. Very poor services. I don't recommend. It has been approx 5 days, but amount is still showing that its in process and still it has amount not been transferred to my account. Really pathetic experience this time. Its an update, i didn't get my amount credit to my bank account, but one thing i would like to suggest is that Cashe needs to improve their customer support. Otherwise its a very good app for sure. Applied for the loan on 24th January. It was approved that day, but the amount is still not credited to my account. The app still shows Processing. Mailed the support team 4 times but still they are unable to resolve this issue. If you can't solve it, you can cancel the loan and you won't do that either. WORST APP EVER, I would not recommend this app to anyone . It says quick, instant loan but my amount got credited in my bank acc after 6 days which I had applied for an emergency purpose that too ₹1000 lesser than the actual amount shown to me. And customer support service is next to zero, cannot call them, they don't respond your emails on time. Not taking the loan from CASHe ever again. Really pathetic experience. Even after being a regular customer of Cashe and paying all the dues in time, it is showing in processing mode for the last 3 days. When someone is in need of urgent requirement then he will be in trouble. There is neither customer support team available on call nor mails are getting answered. I was a having a very good experience earlier but now a days, I do not know why they are taking so many days for loan processing after approval. There is no clarification being mentioned on the app. Initially it was fast and smooth process and hence rated 5* but After paying all the dues on time without fail, when applied for the second time, they don't value existing customers. No response to emails. Very poor customer service. No way you can reach them by phone calls. Very poor services. Had applied to withdraw money from the Credit Line which is still not yet credited even after 3 days and CASHe App is displaying the EMI Amount & Date. I have paid my previous due before time. Now when I need a loan it is still processing from last 6 days. I mailed them for my status they are telling the reason as technical issues. After 1 mail I can't send any emails because their inbox is full. Worst experience For the time being I would like to rate it a 3 star as I am stuck in page where it is asking me to update my bank statement but even though I'm entering my correct credentials, there is an error coming and I do not know what shall I do about it? Till this point, things went smooth but I'm stuck at this point so if the admin could reply to this and resolve my issue it would be great. As I tried chat service but it wasn't helpful and I didn't find other ways to contact customer service. Thank you. CLN12662902 worst customer service. I had sent mail for the foreclosure. I received the response with the payoff amount. I paid the exact amount but in the app it shows a balance of Rs. 21,000/- What the hell you guys send the payable amount but still shows outstanding. Iam following it from the 8th of Jan, still no response. I have escalated it on Twitter and still no response. This app helped when in need, Iam grateful but after paying the amount it still shows pending. It's Awful experience The customer support for this app is very unprofessional and they don't know how to communicate with clients..first hire good staff. It was terrible experience. Thank God that app doesn't work. If before the process they treat there client like this. Means after the loans processing. I don't how the service they provide. I didn't know cashe has disposed down so bad in service. I am a customer since ages and it was working all fine. So far i have 4 loans and have prepaid all of them. Eventually u guys increased the limit and changed all user friendly settings and made life miserable. I have applied for the loan and now no way to contact anyone. From 2days it's still processing. Once there was a time where the loan was just in a minute. Worst service. It has been more than 40 hours and I haven't received the loan amount yet even though I had applied for a pre-approved loan offer from Cashe. Very disappointed with the delay caused. The Cashe application and the cashe customer care claims that it takes only a few hours to transfer the money but, this is not the case. I've not received any reply to my email in this regard from customer service as well. Very poor service. It's really disappointing now..! The application was much better before but this time I'm not at all satisfied with the application. Loan is in process from 8+ days and still is not credited to my account? I applied for an emergency but just because of your fault I'm facing problems. If you will run your application like this then what's the use for applying loan from your application. Unsatisfied with Cashe. Worst application. A very good app indeed. Very easy to use interface with the benefit of taking a loan a few hours after installing the app(now that's fast). They even offer scholarships for students. It's a very helpful app in times of your need. But never forget that you are taking a loan and it's not for free. I recommend folks to use the money wisely as it can be very tempting to use it otherwise. Some stuff can be improved but nothing major. Thanks CASHe. With love -MIKOGet a virtual credit right away.Quick Loans for everyone. been using cashapp with no problems at all, by far the quickest simplest and easiest way to send and receive payments , usually in my bank account within an hour !!! just only send money to people you trust ( same as bank transfers ) you wouldn’t do a bank transfer to someone you don’t know without getting the actual goods , that’s why stupid people leave negative reviews !! I'm happy with cashe app!!💗 UI good, but Emi payment is not reflecting effectively, only email is the option to elevate the issues. I Wrote many times but my issue not resolved. Also I booked Waiting list train ticket and it cancelled automatically irctc refunded the amount but in the app still showing loan outstanding. Im giving one star no Customer care Help line number, only email so Time taken , not effective Very useful app. It takes only 2 to 3 steps to get a result. Its EMI rate is very less than other types of applications.The software allows you to track your spending and check your credit score. Most disappointed, for login itself it asks OTP, then PIN, not recognise the uploaded documents, rental agreement is 2 pages, but it is asking for 3rd page, nothing happened, no customer service, only the pre populated messages are thrown up, pathetic service. No response also, But receiving lot of promotional messages even after uninstall, they don't deserve even 1 Star I always come to this app, even though I had a low credit score at first.. In the end I would say, Interest rate is the lowest. I have had the best experience with this appAdaptable and tuned to perfection.Impressive instant loans when in need. It has been approx 24hrs , but amount is still showing that its in process and still it has not been transferred to my account. Really pathetic experience this time. Its an update, i got my amount credited to my bank account. So thankyou for that, but one thing i would like to suggest is that Cashe needs to improve their customer support. Otherwise its a very good app for sure. i am using this app from last 1 year. Everything was going great however the things have changed now. The service has become too much worst. I appied for a loan on 25th jan 2023 and it is now 28 but i didn't recieved any amount. i emailed them 10 times but still i am getting reply that the issue will be resolved soon. This is really terrible. i would have given 5 stars as per past experience with this app however currently they doesn""t even deserve 0 star as per the experience i have now. What has gone wrong with Cashe !! It's been more than 48 hours , and I still haven't received the funds. This is a concern and I got a mail where they have mentioned they are facing a issue at the bank end but it never should take this long to fix. CLN Number: 1460136. Can someone from cashe technical team fix this issue urgently. Really very bad experience, It's been 5days applied for a loan but still the amount has not credited to my account they have given a credit line but I would say no use, People will apply loan for emergency cases but it's taking very long time. There is no customer care to reach out which is very poor Kindly don't say now regret inconvenience just improve the quality of app and works needs to be done quickly. They are falsely advertising instant loans. Its been almost a day and I haven't received my amount. They have several complaints. I have been sending them emails and I just got one response which I was already aware of. I recommend that this app should removed for false advertising. Submitted all the required documents, but never processed the loan. Waited for 10 days at last rejected the profile with no proper reason. No customer care number. No immediate profile verification is done, they take longer time to verify the profile but at last rejects. Excellent.I truly adore this app, but it's been awful for the past three months. I've taken out loans before and paid them back on time, but for the past three months, every time I apply for a loan, it says to wait for the next six months, and today it says, ""We are unable to process your loan due to certain anomalies in your profile or bad payment behavior,"" despite the fact that I've never missed a payment and always paid on time."" When it came to repayment, they contacted multiple times, but when it came to service, they refused.☺️Need Urgent Personal loan? Get CASHe Not that great experience. I got such a less credit even though KY credit score is good. Just say my payment is 5k I only got 1k as a credit which is really bad. I had no bank statement ready so I asked them to wait till I get it and upload it but they gave credit w/o that. But they had my salary slip so it shouldn't have been so bad. It's a very terrible experience ...i apply for a loan it's approved..all mandate,esign...are completed...bt the credit limit available shows 0.. and active loan is processing...also cashe send me an email that there was technical issue bt resolve 2 days..butamount yet not credit in my account ..it's over 2 days....Also now I when email them..they not response.. Its been a week since my loan is approved. But still the status is we are transferring to your account. Technical issue. 3 days back received a mail that it will take 2 working days and now again received a mail as 5 working days. How much time u need to work on technical issue. I don't understand. No customer care . Only for verification there is customer care but not for complaints. Very bad Why it's been promoted as instant loan service app when its actually not. Even after completion of all processes and credit added into Cashe account (took 4 days), it is taking too long for the amount to get credited into bank account..pathetic... annoying... I applied loan yesterday for a medical emergency , I didn't recieved the money yet , customer service is worst , they are not replying , they didn't even know how to communicate with clients , it's showing the credit line is used fully , but i didn't recieved anything . Terrible experience . This app is not for emergency situation. Very bad experience, earlier the approval and disbursal were instant , but this time they had approved on 18-01-2023 but it's been 8 working days 26-01-2023, they haven't credited the amount, still showing processing,l. While applying 1 person from cashe called me told me to do esign and amount will be credited in 30 minutes, but after 8 working days amount not credited. Very very bad experience, I had mailed many times but no reply. Pathetic service this time. Starting time it is fast and smooth, I always pay on-time payment without fail and i maintain good cibil also.. I have applied for another loan after clearing all the dues, it is showing under process from last 2 days, No value for existing customers, They don't have customer care number also to talk... What is the value for the word INSTANT PERSONAL LOAN any time.... I don't reffer to install this app .... 🙏🙏🙏 Earlier this app was working fast but now it is not working same as it is supposed to be . Even after having a very good credit score they provide me a lesser amount and even though after approval it has been more than 5 days amount is not disbursed in my account ,very poor customer service there is no way to communicate with them delayed reply to mails watsapp support is also of no use every time it says at this moment I m not able to help you kindly try after some time. My CLN #11993229 Very very bad Experience i had apply for the Loan on 23rd January, more then 10 days has been completed but there is no proper response. I had send a mail but no use. also I had uploaded the bending documents. there is no response I am unable to reach customer care. Very poor customer service, very disappointed After 10 days 3rd February The request has been rejected I am not suggest to anyone. First you have to provide proper customer service. This is the second time am applying loan. I preclosed the loan and applied again my credit limit has not increased and amount has not credited to my account. It's showing processing. No contact no to contact them. For mails there is no reply. This app allows you to get a credit right now.Customer service is also excellent, but your apps have one issue: after logging out, I have a log in problem, which I believe is due to a network problem.... CASHe, thank you.Cashe gets you instant loan transfer. This app is just annoying. First it shows that I'm eligible for loan then I uploaded all the necessary documents for the loan including bank statements then after I applied for a small loan through e credit line after one day they rejected my loan and showed that I need to verify my salary account through net banking so again I correct my profile by adding net banking details and submitted my loan request once again. After one day they rejected again showed the same issue. Total waste of time Seriously one of the worst app. There is no way to contact the customer support. Yesterday evening i was informed by cashe representative that the amount would be credited and as of now it's not done and the virtual assistance really bad. We need loan for our personal emergency but this app and the business people don't understand that i guess. I will not recommend anyone to take loan in this app. Rest is upto you This is the worst app. The customer service is inefficient and don't reply on emails. I have asked for foreclosure amount as I paid 1 lakh and thought that the interest will reduce but it's still showing the same and no information is being given to me about how much do I need to pay to foreclose the amount.",support,cashe.co.in,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,Google Play license check control vibration draw over other apps full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup set an alarm view network connections receive data from Internet,0

In the beginning i was unable to load the money to my card noe transfer to my bank, for more than 2weeks after the loan was approved. But it got resolved. Now I'm able to transfer the amount to my bank account without any hassle. Customer support needs to be more prompt. The app is super fine and easy to use. I would recommend it to all. Thank you Team Stashfin 👍👍👍 Very convenient app. And very useful at times of emergency. In the beginning i was unable to load the money to my card noe transfer to my bank, for more than 2weeks after the loan was approved. But it got resolved. Now I'm able to transfer the amount to my bank account without any hassle. Customer support needs to be more prompt. The app is super fine and easy to use. I would recommend it to all. Thank you Team Stashfin Don't go for this loan app. I am stuck taking credit and not seeing option to pay the bill. I have open several tickets and all tickets have been closed mentioned not able to contact on ragister mobile number however my ragister number is the one using for several years. Also there is no direct customer support contact number to reach. They are just trying to make money through converting bill into EMI. Initial process is smooth till you get the loan amount sanctioned. Nightmare starts from missed repayment date. They keep sending legal notices, each time with a different amount and even when the amount has been paid, still you keep getting harder notices with threatening messages. I wrote to customer care multiple times to update the payment details and check the messages that keep coming to me but no one bothered to respond, neither call on my alternate contact number nor reply to my emails. It was a good app to borrow money. Recently their service has just degraded. I'm getting 'stashfin has stopped working' error and have sent messages on chat section but no one has bothered to contact me They don't even have a helpline number or valid email. I'm disappointed at the recent experience. Very convenient app. And very useful at times of emergency. In the beginning i was unable to load the money to my card noe transfer to my bank, for more than 2weeks after the loan was approved. But it got resolved. Now I'm able to transfer the amount to my bank account without any hassle. Customer support needs to be more prompt. The app is super fine and easy to use. I would recommend it to all. Thank you Team Stashfin 👍👍👍 Useless person is working there, System showing available credit limit, but if I transfer that amount then system is not allowing, also I have requested for credit limit increase, but concern team is not response to that, they are doing sleeping only. Management cannot be look that, I have received your credit approx 3 year before, I have paid payment time to time, but till is not increased for my credit limit. Last 3 year is same credit limit. Worst service. Customer care service team is waste This is very dangerous application. I used it as per their intrest rate commitment they increase automatically and deduct from account . They deduct you4 amount three times a month and will add penalty.which cost 500 automatically.change 1 time 2 time. They don't provide statement. And threaten to me also. For legal. Don't use stashfin . 36% of intrest anum amount they charged after the loan released then 3 times extra penalty. And 3% processing fees which is very high. As per Rbi rules 1% only Very convenient and hassle free fast process. Got my application approved within 20 minutes and received an unexpected credit line of 75000 within 20 minutes and got loan amount disbursed in 30 minutes. Very useful in emergency situations. One of the best apps. I hope for our best interactions with the interface and the lenders. One of the best apps for loan. It just took me 5 minutes to enter the details and get approved for a credit limit. Within seconds I could transfer that credit limit to my bank made me feel wow! It was so clean and fast. I really appreciate the team for this. Got an option to check eligibility agai, but the app doest move ahead with the offers. And sending false message that you are eligible for 10000 instant credit line. Stop this False promotion. Very cheap way of marketing. Pathetic. Dear, sir. Please take a note that I have till date not received the credit card and also I am not able to use the credit facility showing in my stashfin app account. You are humbly requested to please look into the matter and resolve this issue at the earliest. This application of me is pending from long. Thus is what stasfin is. Be aware! It's a extreme day light fraudulent group. They will steal your data and can use for their illegal activities. Once you allow them all the permissions and bank account you will notified that congratulations you can avail the loan and as soon as you re-open the app for the disbursement process, only one pop up will shown on the screen and that too acknowledge you that you're not eligible for the loan and no option to find our profile, account and data and no option to edit or delete it. I have downloaded the app and have applied personal loan for emergency purposes. One day over But still showing "" Your Application submitted successfully and i will be getting notifications once credit line unlocked"" No customer care number and no help options in this app... Initially I received one sms that my account (with masked account number) is credited with loan amount. I am not sure how they got my number, then there was one link that redirected me to this application on Play Store. What was really strange is it was sending sms to a personal num. Very bad customer support if you have not registered on this application. Why this application send sms to a personal mobile number????? This looks like not a secure application, please don't use this application. Do not use the app it's my personal experience Hello all, Kindly do not use this app, if you can use your money is gone, i have taken a loan last year July Rs22000 and i tried to use it in Ixigo to book flight ticket but unfortunately i have not received OTP and txn were failed, i tried multiple times but not received OTP also flight fare has been increased. I thought i could use that money in somewhere else, after couple of months i have reopened app and my money is not available in the app. The loan was disbursed and its over 2 days of completion but the amount isn't reflected in my bank account. I have raised ticket several times but didn't get any response from team. Very bad experience. I prefer to not to install this app they disbursed loan but the amount didn't reflected in bank account and they asking you for EMI totally illegal app Very poor service 👎👎👎👎👎 Guys, don't even try getting into this app. It's a total fradulent app, it just collect data, there isn't no proper customer service and they just have plentyful of excuses for themselves. It's better to go for other apps rather than wasting time here. A very bad experience. I would not even rate it 1 star. Very soon uninstall this app . I have also raised a ticket for deletion of account permanently. because their are no use. . Worst app ever experienced there is no customer support and my application is still not updated it's status for 2 days, I even done the ENach but when I reopen the app it still showing I need to do ENach. Worst settings ever. Guys, don't even try getting into this app. It's a total fradulent app, it just collect data, there isn't no proper customer service and they just have plentyful of excuses for themselves. It's better to go for other apps rather than wasting time here. A very bad experience. I would not even rate it 1 star. Fake app, it shows me 3 laks approved but when i transferred the amnt from app to my account, it shows error code and every time they replied with computer generated message with the same ticket number. By this you can easily note that this is a fake app. Fraud app. It cheated me.I've paid the loan amount on time but it still shows pending amount. I took loan in the month of September 2021. I paid each and every emi on time but they didn't update it and because of it my CIBIL got affected. Please don't trust this app. I have been paying time to time the loan due payments from one year. Now when I require amount, they say system is not allowing. I think they donot have any manual method of granting loan. It's waste when they donot consider a loan when required. They say to wait for 90days. It does not honour who pays regularly. They allow technical reasons when we need badly. Gold loans give extra easily than this. Recently I have started with this platform. Everything looks good and fast but after completing all required formality app showing the msg - Thank you for contacting us. Congratulations! Your application has been approved for Rs. 60000. Some of your documents are still pending and we may contact you to get those uploaded. We appreciate your patience. Now what I have to understand I don't know. Useless, not able to transfer funds to bank account after approval. And now it's still shown in progress . Totally useless. It's not instant as per ur guidline i have done everything but it is still showing in progress after limit approved........ I have been applying for a loan for six months now, but my loan has not been approved yet, but this company gives loans to those who do not have the ability to repay the loan, but we are not given despite our ability. Very very bad company, I am another. See that app in the weekI will uninstall it, Even though my credit score is good, I didn't get loan it and I have to wait even after submitting the complete documents😡 I got loan of 30000 from this app. Which was 12 months old. I downloaded its 3 installments. I got another ₹ 30000 credit limit separately which was at zero percent. I took ₹ 20000 out of it and paid the full amount in the next month. But now my limit is blocked. If the limit is blocked even after paying time to time, then this is a useless app! As I have never missed a single payment in last 2years it's smooth. Thismonth my payment missed so had tough time the way executive speaks. I have paid the emi immediately, and also paid 2 more emis pending to complete the loan. It's been a week's time app is not updated the payment still. Raised ticket couple of times Mr uttam is trying to help me at his best but app still not updated. I had write here as there is no number to call customer care. It's possible only when the executive call. Line of credit approved but when you try to withdraw you suddenly become ineligible. What illogical processes do you use to decide eligibility. One of the most stupidiest apps around. Try others please. There are many Stashfin competitors that manage operations a 1000 times better. Say no to Stashfin. Its trash! Very bad experience with the app, after completing all the process, showing you are eligible for particular amount.. after applying for that.. it shows your are not eligible..... Literally can't refer to anyone Worst experience.. when I was doing my nach suddenly whole app crashed. I ve been looking for a customer care no and which ever is provided in web doesn't work. I worried my details are there with them and I haven't got a single response yet from them. Disappointed Very bad app. High interest rate. Only one time loan app. Everyday they send msg for pre-approved loan for 12000 but in app they rejected everytime.. What the hell is this everyday getting messages of pre-approved loan if you are not able to provide loan why send this type of messages?? I am sick of your pre-approved loan messages which are fake. Don't you shame?? Let me tell you, They will send links in the registered email and saying "" transaction amount for loan of high amount"" is approved, and they give the link to download, after that they cut a sorry message- "" loan cannot be approved"". They must know it takes very few seconds to un install their app and never trust them. Worst resourse manager - stashfin Worst fin service company I ever seen . False commitment and in the name of gov. They change there policies and working frequently. First they offer credit period like other credit card company gives after that sudden they close there physical card and now this company is only give loan directly without free credit period and charges highest rate of interest and other charges...Some big fraud happens Horrible.For last two days they were saying my loan is approved and will take 72hrs to get credited.Today they are saying my application is under review. Simply horrible. They ultimately resolve my queries and credited the amount.The feedback call was very cooperative. Thank you Very very very pathetic service. I request not to ever go with Stashfin for loan. Even after paying 50rs of Emi they charge u 500rs of penalty charges even on time of you are paying you still have to bear penalty charges.. No one connect with us not on call nor on chat they will raise no of tickets but none will be cleared and directly they close that tickets. They are not eligible for 1 star also. I request not to ever go with this service they are not good at all. I submitted all my documents and successfully submitted but there is no credit line for me from two months , i raised issue but not solved and they showed me it's resolved. It's all horrible i applied loan just now .. but it showing .. amount will be credited in 2 working days .. not received money.. it's fake app.. my data loan emi was shown in app but money was not transferred to my account ... please resolve this .. not found amount not found utr number .. it's fraud app Not happy with the service at all.i have paid my loan before the time but now the application is showing blank. Not displaying any loan offer. This thing is happening repeatedly.

My pancard is crystal clear and easily readable/scannable. I've no clue what system do they use. If you're in emergency then try some other app. This app will make you frustrated for sure. Overall experience is not so good. They approved the amount but I am eligible for higher amount. Also my booster credit limit has been approved and my income statements are validated. Still they provided small amount. This seems to be misleading and follow different practices. Not so useful for borrower like me. It's a very cool app it is a very big company any service. I used it with no problem and very easy to apply personal loan app and great app, very good service. If anyone needs a loan in case of emergency, please go to LoanFront personal loan application. Everything is fine, especially the duration of the position is good, you have to choose the available options. Thank you very much team 🌹 This is very useful app it is very fast and quick loan disbursement and customer service is also very support and process is very quickly and low emi tenure also very good. I am very happy like this loan front app, my loan for increase please, and me thank you for your supporting and helping so much... Weird. Every time I repay the due loan amount and when trying to get the loan it giving me an error. Contacted customer and agent informed me that you will get the loan instantly after one day which was not happened. This is a good lending loan app infact however not sure why it says like that all the time. Not so happy with the services. After the completion of documents I was approved with loan amount and ECS also done, it was written that money will credit within 48hours but no amount credited yet. This is not excepted. This is very very brilliant app for me, i actually was scared after read reviews but no way it's so satisfying, i approve limit first of 3000 and now after payment it's 5000 with 3 months tenure, what i want other than that? Don't believe haters, just go for it...love you loan front Such a good application for emergency and it's give us a good time to repayment and aslo charge not much interested on loan amount.

<b><u>Minimum and maximum period for repayment, Maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR), a representative example of the total cost of the loan, including all applicable fees</u></b>
Loan amount: ‎₹ 1,000 - ‎₹ 10,000
Minimum and maximum period for repayment: 61 - 365 days
Interest: 12% per annum, i.e. 1% per month
Other fees: we charge one-time processing fee 
Maximum APR which includes interest rate plus fees: 35.9%

Representative example of the total cost of the loan, including all applicable fees: if your loan amount is ₹ 10,000 and period for repayment is 62 days (with two equal installments in 31 day each), interest is 12% per annum with one-time processing fee of ₹ 1,200, then total cost of the loan is ₹ 10,000 * 12% * 62 / 365 (interest calculation) + ₹ 1,200 (all applicable fees) = ₹ 204 + ₹ 1,200 = ₹ 1,404 and total amount payable is ₹ 10,000 + ₹ 1,404 = ₹ 11,404 with monthly payment = ₹ 11,404 / 2 = ₹5,702.

Worst application Your email address is not found ,I v applied for loan it more than 3 days, it's showing in process what is the meaning for an emergency loan, useless app, Never use this app. The response even through mail is same. We are processing. Hectic response system. They simply collect your data and last it shows like IN PROGRESS. it's almost 3hrs and the same displaying like it's in process. When I saw an regarding this app it's showing like 24*7 service and will be processed in 10 mins. While coming to real phase of this app it's deadly slow and got to know after going through FAQ like it will work only till 17.00hrs, weekends it won't process anything. When I applied for the loan there was showing it usually take no more 10 min but its been more than 3 days still showing in processing don't know why ! Third class app. Since last 24 hours it's showing loan application in progress and ""it should not take more than 10 min"". It's simply a data collection app. Don't install this. It's a fraud apps.

This approval message is shown on a time daily when I check my Loan status but no actual transaction happens. Therefore I declare this app a fraud against its commitment on delivering the loan amount in just 10 minutes. They are collecting all your data with photos . Never ever install this app i have requested for a loan thrice this year no use. But surely they will take adhar, pan , bank details, your photo . Iam not having a good feeling regards this. I tried this app as it says the money will be credited in 4 hours. Guys please avoid this app as it is a complete fraud app. My money never credited to my account and the customer care response is almost no. Highly disappointing. Dear RapidPaisa team, just for 1k please don't fool customers.

Used and will continue to use. Everything is fast and convenient. I've been using this app for the past 2 months and it's AMAZING! I use it for the cash advance option (which I usually get in minutes each time) but it also has some great extra perks, like upcoming bill notifications. Cross perfect for a loan application.

Borrow money are very convenient. They are easy to contact and always go the extra mile to find a solution that suits your loan needs. This app i think only data collection app..long time it shows processing stage,.not provide any loan..so don't apply I can't able to apply loan And many times it's shows that loan is in progress and not disbursement Kindly revert Does this app really give loan to the needful customers. I have applied for loan but the problem is same no sign of approval it said It usually takes 10min but its around a day no sign of clearance. Plz dnt fool the customers. App says approval in 10 minutes .. but it has been 1 day since I applied .. and to much interest rate for 1000 rs you need to pay 1500... Great quick service and approval. Simple process, clear understanding of payment terms and details. I was so impressed with how quickly the funds were in my bank account. I believe I will continue to use the service for this loan money app. Total loan application was filled perfectly and uploaded all documents properly but from 2 days it is showing that INPROGRESS... How Much time it will take to give a loan after all your procedures done.. really Bad experience....i have already contacted throgh mail also still they are saying that wait wait....is this the way to treat after all documents submitted .very poor...check my mail to you ....very poor loan app...waste appp App shows in progress after months it's recollect your data and shows in progress it's not working in need Installed multiple loan apps, had trouble registering one and had to wait a long time. This money loan app is a godsend. I had a great experience of borrowing money in banks. But this app makes my life easier. Not even deserves a single star.. Worst app ever.. I applied for a loan and they offered me very low loan amount and when I applied for a loan by submitting all the docs and it's showing under process. They simply say that loan amount disbursed in 10min. But they are fake. From past more than 15 days my loan is showing as under process. Service is very pathetic. I request everyone not to install this app. Their service is very pathetic and they are not trustworthy. very nice and easy to take loan. only adhar and pan card se. Same day loan is an absolutely amazing app. It's so easy to use...whether you are looking for a short term loan, or just need some short term loans, it's the best way to get the money you need! This app is amazing and I love it! Applied for level up loan and it still in progress stage after96 hours. Either you give loan or reject delaying, you dont have phone no to call🤔 I used this app to get a loan in a row. The process was simple and the funds were available within seconds after I submitted my request. Signing up is also simple. I definitely recommend! I have signed the agreement also and it's been 2 to 3 hours been gone but the amount is not transferred to my account in detail they the amount will be credited to you in 10 minutes. But not transferred still know. Dear Rapidpaisa Team, App is always showing hectic process, almost 3 days passed but same update is showing in app and whenever I am emailing,I get a reply it's a hectic process. Please check and do the needful. Yours faithfully, Ansha Yadav. I love this payday application. It is convenient to use. It is always available. No credit card required, you can get a quick and easy loan online when you need it. These apps are very useless and fraud, once paid money, after that it has been 5 months, till now the process is being watched, why are you watching when you don't have to pay Don't use this app they store your data and says 10mints approval and amount will be transfer within 10 mints it's more then 24 hours don't use no customer care number nothing...

Giving reward by rejecting application to regular customers. Shold be removed from Play Store. Third class app. Fraud app,they first provide loans but if you paid them before due date than you apply as many times you could but they would never Sanction any loan saying their NBFC partner didn't sanction the loan which is all lies .They are data collection agency just like 7 day illegal agency in the name of NBFC .Such a scamming app.Need to remove all my documents from it because they could mis use it .Stay alert! And for a fact I know their answer that their NBFC partner decide the credit limit 😡 Don't install this app their are not giving any loan but they are active ur loan money is not credited to your bank account but loan activated if i complete they will tell 2 to 3 days Money will come i send my bank statement also no one give the reply Fraud app It's was better, But Now Loan EY Overed.

Although, interest rates are high but I believe that's the business policy. My experience as if now has been nice. Once you pay back you can borrow again, but maintaining the repertoire by paying on time is important to get more credit access. Cheers guys! I have to say one word about this App. It's elegant, smooth, hassle free & very nice UI features. Although, interest rates are high but I believe that's the business policy. My experience as if now has been nice. Once you pay back you can borrow again, but maintaining the repertoire by paying on time is important to get more credit access. Cheers guys! It's wonderful to have. Especially if things come up unexpectedly with the best time period to repay which is 180 days, especially during this covid-19.😭😭 Hard times for everyone and it's fast and convenient and helps take the weight off shoulders. Plus it's nicely set up to where they took the consideration of a payment plan that is set up (dates wise) pretty far apart from each other so you have time to pay it off. it's not in big chunks of money.... depending on the amount. Everyone had turning points in life. It was so terrible that I made myself think that it was a nightmare. I needed a money loan to solve one problem. You know, I met such terrible conditions. I was offered so high percent. Fortunately, I found this loan app. The conditions for getting loans online are satisfactory, with low interest and 90 days for repaying. I happened to use these INSTANT loan app a couple of times now and I can say for sure that it has been a pleasant experience indeed. The approval is very quick and the registration doesn’t take much effort like in some other apps, it helped me a lot, with easy loan on repayment period of 90 days!. First-time users will have no trouble navigating and learning how to utilize the interface because to its user-friendly layout.

I have no problem agreeing to your request for an indefinite loan. Since it is made with novices in mind, the interface may be navigated and used with ease. Thanks to the layout's lack of distractions, it's simple to read the content. I haven't had any difficulty so far, it has been satisfactory so far, and I kept doing as I was asked.I got my tenure upgraded from 90 to 180 days recently which was just awesome.

I have not received any information regarding the payment closure. The app still shows ""The payment is due"" please solve this issue! It's been 24 hours but the issue remains the same. I have shared the screenshot of the payment through mail, no response from you guys! I'm very much disappointed. Yes it's a good app. They issue a loan very easily and it's super easy to get that loan in your bank account. Although they haven't gave me any limit in the beginning but then they gave me a limit and i used and paid. And they charge you any interest only if the bill is generated. It's like a credit card with no physical card and additional features I have made the payment, but it still shows outstanding. I have not received any information regarding the payment closure. The app still shows ""The payment is due"" please solve this issue! It's been 24 hours but the issue remains the same. I have shared the screenshot of the payment through mail, no response from you guys! I'm very much disappointed. This is a great app. It was quick and easy to get loan. But it is very difficult to request changes related to bank account and auto debit. My old bank account has been closed and I have reached out several times to get help to change bank account. I am told to make manual payment but whenever I make manual payment through app it does not go through and the money also gets debited. I have been charged late fee again and again due to this. I just need to foreclose the loan now. I have made transfer from Credit ATM to my Bank account on 30-11-2022 but it shows still processing. I couldn't contact their customer support. I have tried many times to contact them through WhatsApp. It says please hold for a while to connect to the available agent but i couldn't receive any response from. Everytime i contact it says like that. I'm using this app for the past 6 months .... It was fast in crediting amount to bank. But when i requested money for this month this app shows processing from past 7 days ... I tried to contact these people through mail and mobile number but there is no response .... This is not the right way ... Please solve my issue I have been using the application for a while now, it used to be good. Now when I make a withdrawal that money isn't credited over 8days. App sayings in 2 working days. Totally worthless when your really in need of money. The customer support doesn't respond to mails. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone in real need. Very bad app, earlier it was instant process, now a days this app shows it will process within 2 days,it's almost 6 working days it's still on same thing,may won't have fund. And very worst customer care services, they won't reply on time. Even there company mail no one there to reply. They provide only 2000 to 2500 loan after using it 1 year or so. They won't increase your limit. Very pathetic service, I suggest don't use this app.Dont want to give single star also. Be aware fake alert. They were very good before i had taken loan as well but now since last month the service is not good, no customer care support to reply and resolve the issue. the status is showing as in process and it's been 3 weeks no update about the loan amount. What is the point if we don't get the money when in need. I have requested for withdrawal from the account and it is still showing in process from last 12 days, i dont know what is wrong with this app, i did not recive the amount from 12 days, and i have called on coustomer service, they just say that there is technical error and they are working on it, every time you call them they say the same thing l, worst service and support I applied for bank transfer, it's more than 5 days but I still didn't get the amount in my bank. Whenever I speak to your agent over chat, they always say it takes 2 days and end the chat. This is not right on your part. I will not be using this app and I do not recommend to anyone. Worst app as I have experienced for one month they take extra charges and next month charges is 7.5℅ . So do not use this app it's froud app . After paying that also the payment are not successful the credit report are not updated. It shows 24hrs for the payment to take place App is good but limit was not increased. So disappointed after done payment on time limit not increased. Fraud app from last 2 months they say amt will credit in 2 working days. I had applied loan but still after 5 days no amt received. I want to cancel this loan if credited in my account I'll not pay and case in consumer court for harassment. Edited after 6 days of applying: Have sent msgs on watsapp 12-15 times. But no response. Mailed also but again no reply. What a pathetic service you have !! If you can't do, pls tell customer atleast directly. 5 days gone but still not received the amount. Mailed twice, sent msg on whatsapp but nothing has been done yet. Used to be a great app. I have always paid the dues on time. But it is showing now that disbursal is stopped due to technical issues since 15 days. I have contacted the redressal officer but they also don't know anything about it. Its a helpful platform to fulfill our needs. Really good.,but crediting money isnt instantly credited to your account it takes 2+ working days to credit. So times it makes disgusting. Credit limit is not sufficient to borrow. Loan under processing since 30 November. I had never delayed any payments, always done on time. Still i had to face this scenario, have already mailed on customer service multiple times & also on whatsapp. Just getting robot reply from server, no human.

*Credit history required if you are residing in New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and West Bengal.",3.8429172,100404,"It's more than 12 hours, all the process are completed, NACH is signed but there is no progress on loan approval. Why don't you do all the verification prior signing the NACH? Please do not advertise with incorrect information that it takes only two hours. It seems after all the process done, when the time of disbursal came, application goes inactive. This is certainly not a good practice. Above all, you demand Rs 199 also which I paid already. It seems a fake application. I applied for a loan in this app. They said loan will be processed in 2hr. It's been more than 3 days. Worst kind of experience. I have upload the bank statement and even mailed the bank statement but no proper reply from them. But they have charged rs.199 as processing fee. Worst customer support. No proper response from them. Don't use this app to get loan. You will lose Rs.199 don't try this app. Team, please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible as I've taken a loan of Rs 10,000/- and the app is not opening. I've tried everything. I tried restarting it, reinstalling the app and also normally starting again. Please help me resolve the issue. The amount is disbursed but I'm unable to repay it...please help ... First of all I dnt want to give one star also,but it wont take .I m trying to close my account from past one year but there Support is not responding and closing the ticket for each response.Just they need money.I suggest everyone to dnt go for this app it very worst when you to go for payment on time know there will be some error and you cant see anything in the app .Later you will get Notification with Due amount. Its a worst app ever seen. After 5 days no amount credited in account, this is 3rd time, after mandate sign everything done. Fake app. Plz don't go this be u z they didn't credited amount.. And loan application showing open due to that cibil dropped.. Plz solve the issues... If u r not able to credited the approved loan amount. Plz close the loan application , zero star from my side.... This app is fake. I paid 199 rupee fee for assessment of documents and credentials. After that online e mandate registration was enabled. I tried to submit the mandate but it is showing as failed. Tried it more than 10 times then manual mandate option is coming. Why should I give manual mandat.Are we in stone age. This is by far the worst app i have ever encounter. First they ask u to pay 199 then for weeks your application is on process like bank statement verification and all and after that they reject your application saying income not verified. Every month I get payment and tet they say income not verified. Other app like branch and kreditbee are far better than this fraud app. After installing the application they will you to pay 190 for credit score check,after the payment you will get sign out from the application and you won't be able to sign in again ,I already sended the an mail to them but no response. It's just a fake application Recently a month ago i had paid 199 and then the app shows that my loan got canceled, and now again I've paid 199 and it's still showing processing from last 10hours, can you please suggest what to do or how to do, if you've to give then please give as soon as possible, it's an medical emergency for me and even after mail you're not responding. Please look into this and please disburse the loan asap. FRAUD APP BEWARE. They show you approved amount, ask you all the document and even Assesment fee to pay upfront which is non refundable, ask youtoset up ENACH even before the disbursal and after all the agreement acceptance and auto repay setup it moves to verification eligibility (i mean seriously?) Why to show approved amount at first place ? And later they declined the loan stating no reason. I have already made the payment yesterday, it's been 24 hrs and payment still not showing up as paid, it is showing as due pending. I asked one of your employee and he is saying he will not update the payment since I have made payment late. Customer service is worst, they will never respect the customers. I want to say App is genuine, yes they take 199 processing fees and money takes atleast 24to disbursed in account. But they are genuine. Second interest rate is not to high but the app is seriously very slow literally insta money you have to something about app. Hi Team, I have mailed to your mail id and over 2 hours but did not get any amount from your side. Please check and do the needful for today's otherwise decline my application and do not call or Sms and also delete my data with documents from everywhere. It's an urgency. Very bad services ""HIGH ALERT"" please do not install this app as i ...Paid the processing fee ... Got 199 detected from my bank account and instamoney says that they did not get the amount of 199 i am ready to share my bank details but the back end team mailed me stating that they did not receive it and it's been reversed back to my bank account which was not the case as it's been many days i paid and did not get anything... Please beware of this app... Bad experience.. This is not insta loan.i applied for loan and pre 10000 pre approved show on screen after i submited all documents & 199fees & successfully link net banking & also sign agreement successfully but 24 hours are gone but not show my loan status.. I send two time e-mail to insta money for know my loan status but not respond till than. So very bad experience. It is more than three days now it is showing that the loan is approved but no further development. An amount has already been taken of Rs 199 but nothing has happened since then. The app claims that it approves a loan within 2 hrs but it is more than 36hrs nothing has happened. I have written an email as well but no reply. Kindly let me know the exact process!!! What will be the total time required to disburse a loan. What is the customer care number??? I have applied for the loan and i have also paid the 199rs fee and then the app is showing 16500rs pre approved loan after kyc the app says it will take 2hr to transfer the money now it's been 5 hr no response. Please don't download this app and pay the subscription fee as this is a fake app. Thanks After charging an assessment fee of 199 rs they responded after 1 day saying they are not able to lend me money because of some issue... Told me to re apply after 3 months... This is totally absurd... Everyone please don't fall into prey of these scam money lending apps... I am done with them you should too! Instead go and ask a friend ! Fraud App. They just scam you for paying 199 and then they just reject it without any explanation. Had taken loan once paid all due right before time and still they decline for no reason. Absolute scam it is. I would suggest you to prefer some othe instant loan apps, they have a worst service and if you get late for 5days loan officers message harras and threaten. I personally had a very bad experience with them, collections team abuse you send you vulgar messages, one of the loan officers is Atul. I would suggest to choose some other app. This app is fake. I paid 199 rupee fee for assessment of documents and credentials. After that online e mandate registration was enabled. I tried to submit the mandate but it is showing as failed. Totaly froud app. Only data colection and money colection. Worst service.. My friend paid 199 rupees two times as processing fee.. But even though we have good payments history and good credit score they are rejecting loan after paying 199 rupees... They're not even returning 199 rupees If you call yourself as an instant money app,then your services should also be instant. When one is paying advance emi to opt for a new loan. It should get updated instantly and new loan should be available but your email says it will take 5 days to get updated. Really not a better services Worst interface ever, took 199 as processing fee, was not able to verify the bank statements, a complete fraud, not able to enter home page.. do not use... Refund my 199 please .. does not go through the enach Very Fast and Quick Servises (updated Current Experience). Till experience Superb Experience, Transparent Details, Low Interest with very fast Process,Recommended to all needy person, Best regards to all Insta Money Team👏👏 Fraud, the app charged me 200 for processing fee and after payment it doesn't allow me to sign. I think I lost them. Please avoid this app and lenders who are asking processing fee in advance. I think I made ha mistake by choosing this app , Frist i taken loan and repaid after that i am getting mail to get loan again i was trying to take loan but it stop at the e nach later it was not able to move further it's keep on getting errors it worst app after paying 200 for two times i didn't able to get the loan Worst App..don't waste your money 199 to apply loan here..they don't respond to our email and there is no proper communication service available..they said they will process in 2 hours but for me it's 4th day and they haven't update me anything till. I was waiting for auto debit to avoid double payment, payment was not deducted on due date and I received message on my WhatsApp, short of threatening message if I'll not pay someone will visit my property. Though I made payment manually and still getting back to back calls from insta money. Can't you guys be updated ,and why auto debit is not working Fake app asking me for payment of 199 for credit report.. you are money lender app debit this amount from my disbursed amount no one is going to pay you in advance and after paying 199 it's stuck in e nach mandate always getting false... It is a fraud app, it is only used to take 199 fee from user and gaining its profit. But not providing any loans to the customers. I request please don't use this app it will just take money from customers of rupee 199 as fee but it doesn't provide any loan to the customers. I was not supposed to give one rating also but it is not taking so I have given the one rating. My rating for this app is -0/5. Not zero its minus zero. It is not instamoney app it is a instafraud app. I applied for loan in this app..more then completely finish 2 hours...but not amount credited..also .. processing..but not any support customer service team ..I mail send ..many time there no any live person...very sad feel .not credited loan In the beginning they asked to pay 199 i paid that amount nd after documentation they verify nd asked to do nach mandate it's already verified but still asking to verify I did another way also but at the after 22500 they said you eligible for 21000 when submit request then said you are not eligible declined,very very worst experience After taking information and Nach mandate they declined loan request . I will report to my bank and also fill form to RBI for same this is not the right way. Totally fruad app. First shows approved and taken 199 inr and till e sign it's shows approved and e sign show decline. You can also decline after pan card. I am going to report this issue and ask playstore team to remove this app. totally waste of money they make you feel that they will give you loan and make you pay 199 registration fee for confirmation after that they will so you some options at last they will reject your loan then your registration fee 199 is gone no loan only and they will get 199 bonous total lost is yours so please report everyone otherwise they will take advantage of poor peoples. Worst loan app they sending message of pre approved nd then they took all document with nach process and reject the loan .. If you are not vle to provide it then why sending messages or pre approved???? Again you sending message for loan and after nach completion you rejected then why you doing so process. I think you guys just collected information of customers. Cheated I am changing my review because this app was good before however after last update the app sucks.. I have made a payment on 2.12.2022 but the app has not updated the payment on its app and i m getting Auto call to pay the amount which I have paid earlier and fed up my mood everyday.. this is very disgusting. First update your app check once again whether I have made the payment or not. Such a waste and stupid app is this ,if you are not interested or I say if you are not able to give your money then why and what a use of an application it takes processing fee 199 /- and won't agree to give the amount once it shows to login to the salary credited amount bank after that it asks for the netbanking pin for the past 3 months statements and again it take more than 24hrs to activate and again to shows the nach link to auto debit and it sucks it will show as ipin wrong waste app chi. Worst application. I am unable to login to the app. While I am logging in to the app after entering the OTP its not going anywhere. Even after entering my email id also i am unable to login. I applied for 50k, at first got the limit for 30k then signed the NACH of 30k then showed you're only eligible for 12.5k and finally while signing the loan agreement it became 5k. That too is not credited since last 2 days. Mailed to the team but no response. I think the app to be manipulative.",loan,lendenclub.com,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,Google Play license check control vibration draw over other apps full network access pair with Bluetooth devices prevent device from sleeping read Google service configuration view network connections receive data from Internet,0

The app doesn't even show transaction details. Rubbish app. Other apps like kisht and ring are much better and faster This is the best app among all the loan apps which I am using. The user will get three options to do the repayment, either he can clear the outstanding due or pay the monthly installment or just pay the minimum due. The best part is that your credit score will not have any negative impact by choosing any of the option. I highly recommend this app to someone going through financial emergency... Be aware!! It's not a instant loan app instead it is one of the most delayed app. Not sure if they usually provide any loan facility... if anyone looking for a immediate support try other options. Interface is good but that is not solving the purpose/requirement users visit. Do Not Try and waste time and sharing the data. Would not recommend this app to anyone. They start sending multiple reminder messages a day as early as 7 days before the due date. They also send payment collection requests over UPI, that too for interest amount collection only, If you approve UPI payment request then overdue charge will be levied on principal amount. I would have given half star if it was possible. It helps me think about what I usually encounter, it's nervous, people using the app have told me about it, I've tried it, I'll do my best. It was very easy. Now you have some money to count on until you get paid. The comfortable interface of flexsalary makes it perfect for all people to use flexsalary to get a personal loan instantly. I used to be really bad with money and really stressed out.. Paying my bills has never been easy, but with the help of Pay with Ring it is now so much easier! They have a clear payment plan that is easy to follow and find that paying for my expenses.. I really hoped for this app and they did not let me down. The conditions of the app are great, everything is online, without income certificates and other documents, quickly, conveniently and around the clock, with repay time for 62 days.

We were able to split the payments without any problems, for a period of 90 days of time.... Cool flexsalary app design.. It is understandable, intuitively clear and stylish in some ways.. Used Cash advance app twice.. Everything was fine.. Love the service.. Recommend it to my friends.. From the beginning, they don’t want to have to deal with that service..

<b>Sample Calculation:</b>
Loan amount: ₹ 30,000 at interest rate of 54.75% p.a.
Loan Duration: 65 Days
Total personal loan interest = ₹ 2,925
Processing fees (PF@5% of Loan Amount) + Stamp Duty = ₹ 1500 + ₹ 310 = ₹ 1,810
Total Deductibles (PF + Stamp Duty): ₹ 1,810
In-Hand Amount: Loan Amount - Total Deductibles = ₹ 30,000 - 1.810 = ₹ 28,190
Total repayable Amount(Loan Amount + Interest): ₹ 32,925
PF + Stamp Duty are deducted upfront during the loan disbursal.

The team support is very helpful and guides you through the process and whenever you need help they answer to your questions. I recommend this App to all who is in need of emergency loan, personal loan and other loans as well. Good customer support and guide. ***** I applied for loan and its more than 30 days. Submitted all the required docs, I am asked to click on ""continue"" to proceed for the eligibility and emandate and ""continue "" button is not clickable. I've been chatting with your customer support since 30 days but support at all from there. Quick approved inspite of low credit score, The customer service executive Vishal and OM helped lot when there was technical issue. Thanks a lot for your support. Just make a little changes and have a longer tenure atleast keep 3 months. Within 2 months if the loan amount is higher is difficult to pay. Overall a good experience. The application is very good and the application process is very smooth and the disbursement is very quick. I was helped by Om and Vishal with process quickly and it was completed within few mins. And the plus point is it is giving 64 days time period. I would definately recommend this app to my frnds. Excellent platform to obtain a Loan. Very user friendly interface and the staff is very helpful and responsive. Disbursement was very quick, provided, you furnish all your documents. I personally thank Rahul Rao, for being so very approachable. He went all out to guide and support !. Thank you Team Lenditt for always being with us, in time of need ! Amazing Experience! I've been using Lenditt for a past few months. The experience of getting loans has been always been great. They provide instant loans with flexible tenures and low interest rates and their support from the start of loan application till disbursement is always top notch! I happily recommend Lenditt to all my friends Thank you Lenditt! This app used to very good before five months but right now it seems like that they stopped give the loan I have cleared my full payment before due days of both the emi and when I applied again after one day they rejected the loan because my salary account has been changed from this month so current salary could not verify but I have given the both salary account statement along with current salary slip I have regular in touch with emails and contact no.but no one is bother to revert.useless. Very bad app pls don't use this they take people's money and don't give loan. Worst experience. Even after being a regular costumer for almost a year they did this to me. I paid the loan on the given date which is 100% of my salary and now they are refusing to give the loan back. Please don't use this app will share my experience on twitter and other social media as well. Very bad experience which I felt while using the application, it's take more than 1 hour for check the eligibility.. so far I don't get my eligibility loan amount yet because I had skipped after 1 hour.. i never experienced like this from anywhere I am using this app for the past 3 months.it is very helpful in my difficult situations as they disburse immediately after submitting the documents. special thanks to vishal and om for solving the problems. The experience of app is very nice and Quick supportable from team. Specially Thanks for Vishal and OM for quick support to process the loan. Best experience with team. Really nice work Thanks a lot.. I had very good service from this app and the customer service is awesome, i had some problem this month on app and the person called DINESH helped me out get loan amount. Thank you Dinesh. Very happy with the application. They are very upfront with all charges and interest they charge. Although the app has little glitch sometimes but if approved the disbursement etc takes very less time. This is fraud loan app. If u delay payment, then they will run eNACH twice and will take all your money and won't give back. I took loan of 30k but end up paying 63k and still fighting to get the excess money debited. They are responding that if u delay payment we can't do anything it's company policy. Now they stopped responding. It is good instant loan app, loan processing is fast, process is simple, smooth, loan disbursement was quick and received the amount in very short time.. Genuine , straightforward and hassle free app , if your all documets are in place , you will get disbursal within 10 minutes. Highly recommended Amount offered is decided by the app is something not good , thats what a borrower need to decide perhaps that really depwnda upon cibil , but lenditt ia deciding on its own is not good. Dear Team I have repaid my existing loan need help in reloan but i am unable to upload the statement. Have now more than 10times but unable to upload. Even on customer support no one is there to respond. Can anyone take this on priority and help. I'm honestly impressed with this app. From the start till the end the experience has been amazing. I got stuck at a point but customer service immediately called me and made sure to resolve the issue. I got my loan is like 20 mins max. The process is smooth and the interface of the app is commendable. Hatts off the customer service for being so attentive and making sure that the customer doesn't get troubled with the process.. Love you Lendit - You are a winner ! Thanks for solving all my problems, its performance is very good application and very useful for people who want to get loan with very easy steps I love this application for taking a personal loan with very easy way and first process I use it, the interface is very clear. The approval is quick and the amount is high. If you want to borrow money, you should choose to borrow money. The loan program is really good and convenient. It is a very beneficial loan. Thank keep growing 💐 Such a pathetic app if someone is experiencing any financial issues and unable to pay on time as well as if you made arrangements with to pay later they are going to keep calling your mobile contacts without your authorisation . Not a reference person they are contacting and doing illigal debt collection as well as your personal contacts in mobile phone accessing without your permission part of cyber crime please never take any money from this company. They don't have any financial hardships It's been 2 hours ... I didn't received OTP on my mail id.... Spam , personal , update , forum ,,, all have been searched but no use..how long it will take to reach OTP on mail. It's done...very fast loan within hours your loan amount in your account. While loan application process if you facing any issues. Lendiit exicutive will tuch you all the time. Thanks Lendiit Guys this app is doing illegal activities they put a ESC 15 times a day or more than that of different amount. I didn't repay on time due to medical issue they gave me a loan of 15K and the repayment is 23K + ESC bounce charge 9780. Kindly ensure that you dont give them a auto debit they will nil your bank account if you don't pay on time I reported this incident to Cyber Crime and your team via email no response yet. They have slowest support team who don't know how to help customer.This seems to be a fake app..just to have control of your phone and misuse the data. They don't provide any loans and infact will keep you busy to use their app by any means...their all postive reviews are also fake. BEWARE!!!.... In case of any delay in payments, after we are responding to them also, they are calling our relatives and saying they are not responding to our call... This is blood very cheap trick I don't like in this app Don't buy loan from this app...i make payment before due date, then also ecs was executed on my account. Due to which bank has charged me bounce charges. I have dropped mail with attached bank statement for Reversal. But till now no reversal received. Don't take loan any one from this application Very bad experience. They don't know what is to be done whether they want to provide the loan or not. I completed all the steps I got approved with a certain amount of credit limit, then it suddenly got declined,after giving contact access don't know why. After asking many times from the executives who were taking my all the details, i got no reply. Team Pls check some bugs are still there ...Error VPN server ...unable to reapply or make payment. Else the application is smooth and fast to process. Looking for more option in the application. One of the best Loan App i had come across just a click of your mobile button you get the loan in account. All the process was very smooth from filling the application to getting the amount disburse in my account.... I will definitely recommend to my frnds as well Super fast services, ease of filling the information is commendable and the customer service support is outstanding, this is very good app in emergency, worth recommending to friends and family who are in need. Keep going and growing Lenditt! Fantastic experience. They are pretty clear with charges and documentation. Care support is really good. No hidden charges. I am really happy with the service. Worst app ...take every detail then rejected. If there was option to give Zero I can give 0 rating to this app. This app need every documents then they will decide to give loan or not ...every single document they need to check weather u are eligible or not . At the end they rejected application after giving pre approved limit Was a customer with lenditt for long time, however now they state as not eligible...aside get daily update of to log in & re apply..when i try to do so again the not eligible option pops up...why are you just wasting time of everyone...worst experience with app like lenditt The process was smooth and quick good technical assistance also. The interface of the app is easy to understand Hi I applied for a loan 2 days ago after some pendency on it I also resolved it but till date the customer service has not responded to my mail not on their systematic chat system. I think this worst app ever. Extremely disappointing qnd poor service. Without any valid reason loan is being declined whereas with the same data loan was granted earlier. On questioning,no response from the team. Terrible service. Very bad application. I have repaid my first loan before due date and in one installment instead of 2 but when I have applied for 2 nd loan they have rejected my loan application by saying we could not approve ur loan due to internal credit policy. I am genuine customer who have repaid the loan before time and this is what I got for my early payment. Worst application. Thank you Lenditt for given money to my critical situation. After all the KYC & Document sygn, I got money to my Account. The customer service also very kind and helpful for getting my loan. I taken 3 loans from lenditt. It is very easy and convenient. Thanks. I give more star⭐. But there only 5 Star ⭐. Waste service. Don't take loans in this app.after closing the loan they are not update in cibil. And it's show overdue only. They are not responding mails and calls also. Don't take Loans from this app. Lenditt is a nice app which provides short term loan on a decent interest rate. The team of lenditt is really helpful in case ones get stuck somewhere. This is a commendable team working with leditt.",info,lenditt.com,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,Google Play license check control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

Finkurve Financial Services Limited – https://www.arvog.com/arvog-finance/",4.0265355,107702,"Very Bad experience.I have paid the amount of Rs. 4264/- which is showing due in the app and still not reflecting in app. Amount is deducted second time through NACH , which i have paid . I have complained numerous times and emails also. There is no response and in app chat support its showing updated in system. But still showing due. The app is becoming good to worse. I am using app from long time, now only the issues are coming. Very bad experience. I needed some extra money on urgent basis, so I applied for it. And the loan was sanctioned, loan agreement was signed but it's been 3days the money has not been bisbursed. Raised tickets in the app to contact customer service but no luck. 2 of my tickets were closed, i don't know the reason. One of them is still pending. I did get a call the day I applied saying it'll be disbursed now, after checking and confirming all my credentials. Kinda seems like a fraud app. Very bad experience. My account has been deducted by auto debit on due date. Still I am getting calls to pay the money. I sent emails no reply. I called on customer service they said you will get the call till app is not updated. I was giving him the payment reference number but he did not took it. This is an nbfc registered with RBI. This is disgusting. I am getting calls to pay since morning and I really don't what's going on. I haven't received the loan that was sanctioned. I did receive a call for confirmation before disbursal and the amount was said that it'd be disbursed immediately. It has been more than 48 hours. I really need the cash. What's the point of applying if you're not going to transfer the amount? Edit: I have sent 2 mails already. The second one was sent after they replied to the review. Even after this much of complaints there is no action. I have mailed in the given id for a 10 times. No update. still showing will be disbursed in 24 hrs. This is totally disappointing. Even after the loan is passed it isn't disbursed after 4 months of passing. Even though I havnt made any penalties in repayment. The customer service is hectic. No service at all. Disappointing app. Utterly hopeless. Today it has been 16 days that i have been trying to contact the customer care to update the repayment made by me on 25/12/22 but not yet done. They acknowledge the email and reply but not updating. I have been a customer for more than a year but today i am too disappointed at the way they are working. If you people have technical issues in updating why don't you tell directly. Who will repay you on time if you don't update on time. Seriously worst experience. Such a worrest experience with this app...i have applied for loan and got approval also..but from 3days it shows pending...i have sent mail also but there is no response...if you are not interested to give money...why you collect all the day...time waste....after all submissions and approval...still showing verification pending, how much time to take for verification.... mostly one day....you guys are taking one year for verification... worrest experience... I needed some extra money on urgent basis, so I applied for it. And the loan was sanctioned, loan agreement was signed but it's been 2days the money has not been bisbursed. Raised tickets in the app to contact customer service but no luck. I don't know the reason. One of them is still pending. I did get a call the day I applied saying it'll be disbursed now, after checking and confirming all my credentials. Kinda seems like a fraud app. Very smooth and seamless. Best app for instant loan for salaried. The interface is quite user friendly and the speed of transaction is high too. I havent received the loan that was sanctioned. I did receive a call for confirmation before disbursal and the amount was disbursed immediately. It has more than 6 hours. After I checked in app it show you declined not eligible for loan. I am regular taking loan from this app since one year I using. Not a single problem in previous loan I am facing this issue with the current loan.  And also I have got sanctioned letter then why it get rejected. . This is a fraud app. Got the amount and ecs was done. Today is due date. I got a call in the morning to repay manually. But I am maintaining the amount in my bank account. So I declined to pay manually. Now I got a message from this fraud app that my repayment has been bounced an I have to pay manually to avoid penalty. I just checked my bank account and There is still no deductions happened. The amount is there then why should I pay manually. They just want double payment. I am filing complaint Fraud Alert! On the day of payment they told you are overdue and make us pay through some payment gateway later right after the payment they deducted money one more time through auto debit trigger. Customer service is pathetic. And they are non reachable all the time. Even on app there's no proper customer support. All my documents and e-mandate are completed but loan amount was not credited to my account. I am already waiting for 24hrs still not credited and customer care also not proper response and Raise Ticket option also not responding so worst experience for me. This is the very very worst experience all process done my side but loan amount was not disbursal still now . My process was done 2weeks before but not responding properly so totally fake. One again pathetic service by payme, trying to loot everyone, i was trying to get in touch but no one responded and because of that i have to pay 1500 extra amount. Can anyone explain why i am being charged daily 400 500. I have already paid and its autodeducted also. How's is this possible. Revert my money back. It's been 2 day's. Already sent email,but no satisfactory response. I have to pay other dues also and because of you people my other dues will bounce. Worst every experience. I have applied for loan and it got sanctioned and said it will be credited soon in my bank account, but I have no trace of loan status, it's disbursal. I mailed you people, I raised a complaint but still you have no reply. This is the second time I am facing the issue. If you can't credit the amouto the customer then don't even run these app, just fooling the people you are. Kindly resolve my issue as soon as possible Hi, I had applied loan almost 2 days back but credit still pending. I had raised ticket but awaiting reply and the phone number given in grievence is not working. Also mailed priority support. I have an emergency so applied but what is the use when there is no reply nor proper contact number which is in working condition. Please do needful. Already emailed to concerned department mentioned. No reply from your side My dues amount deducted two times. Number of times i send mail to return my money, even i also send all the transaction details with bank statement. its alrady 5 days left but no body replay. There customer care number is not connected. Its too irritating. I don't understand what's wrong with them. One of the worst and disgusting APP i have ever seen. I signed sanction letter and got confirmation call. It's been more then 24 Hours but i have not received money. And i raised ticket online but no response. Really don't install this app go for some different App their disbursed time is really quick. Really ver disgusting and pathetic,third class App. Fake and Fraud. After setting up auto debit no response what so ever. More than 2 days no disbursal yet. You can not contact customer service as they will going to disconnect your call and if you will try again the IVR says your query has been answered contact after 24 hours. Such a fake app. Disappointed. No help after raising multiple tickets. Very bad service , I have applied only 2500 on date 14/1/2023.. after completion of all the process and emandate it's showing disursbal in 24 hr ,but after 24 hour it's showing payment failed .. also I have raised a ticket for the delay of amount credited but automatically it's closed .. very bad service and also no cotact support.. ""WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE"". credit limit was assigned and e sign and e mandate was also verified. After that it shows with in 24hrs loan amount will be dispersed. But suddenly it shows you are not eligible and apply after 6 months. REALLY! I AM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED. Very poorest service . I never and ever seen such such kind of pathetic service. I apply for loan which is approved but after that there is screen showing that amount will disburse within 24 hour. But it's now it's 5days gone and amount is not credited. I raise a complaint ticket by app . Even I called several times to customer care but till now problem has not been resolve yet and amount is not credited. Very flawless interface.user friendly.also gives transparency to the facts that are mostly hidden in other loan providing apps I am surely going to recommend it to my other mates for best experience. They initiated the disbursement more than 36 hours ago but still the loan amount is not credited. Edit: Now I'm sure that this is fake loan app because it's been more than 2 days still my loan application is approved but not credited to my account. Applied for a loan on 13th December, they called me to collect references etc, on the 14th... signed e-nach and loan document on the same day, app said disbursement in 24 hrs. Then 20th December, no money arrived, raised a ticket requesting cancelation of the loan. 22nd Dec, no response, wrote to grievance, send another reminder... 31st December, same status, no response from grievance. I think, the next step is, they will demand repayment, without paying a loan. Never get in their trap. Pathetic customer support. I already activate Ecs and maintained sufficient fund still they added the bounce charge. I paid the original due amount and mailed the statement to support team but still they haven't replied nor waived off the charges. DON'T TAKE ANY LOAN FROM PAYME. THEY ARE THE WORST. It is a very good instant online student loan app. The app is very user friendly and helpful. This is the only loan app I use and I can guarantee it is very helpful for salary holders seeking loans. It Is the best app to get the instant loan for salaried. The rate of interest is also very good and affordable. This helped a lot of people to get the instant loan. Edited: Old message: After being such a loyal customer for so long, now I am unable to proceed with loan as the app is stuck on nach verification for over a month. Have been dropping emails but the resume I get is that they have forwarded my concern to the respective team. Still waiting for resolution. Their reply: to contact priority support. Result: no change, still no resolution I Applied for the first time. Submitted all the documents as per their requirements, and the loan amount is sanctioned. The app also shows the repayment dates. However, app shows my application is under review and will be finished within 24 hours since morning. No satisfactory response from customer service associate. Very bad experience. Worked well so far. But giving me a little trouble this month. The repayment has been done twice. Tried contacting the customer support, have sent all the requested documents via email. Still have not received a call back from the team enquiring about the issue. Really disappointed. I have paid my loan 2 months back but it is not updated and from last 2 months my credit score decreased from 749 to 650 because of this.kindly update it and close my account. Simply losing my cibil Score even after paying the loan amount. On e of the worst experience in my life. FAKE APP..when I login were Showing here you are eligible here for 6000 credit limit and when I applied it showed my limit only 2000 rs. Then I applied 1000 rs. loan from 2000 Credit limit and final still haven't received the money after filling the form and I'm shocked after 24 hours still money isn't disbursed in my bank Account..So I Personally recommend to all PLEASE DONT INSTALL THIS AAP ITS TOTALLY ""FRAUD APP"". Worst app ever I have got the credit limit of 4k but whenever I try to apply for the loan it simply shows me the message that my profile is under review and wait for 24hrs but when I try to apply for the loan since 4 days ago but still I am getting the same message .. fake app. Very Bad experience.I have paid the amount of Rs. 4088/- on time ..which is showing due in the app and still not reflecting in app. I have complained numerous times and emails also. There is no response and in app chat support its showing call shortly our coustomer representative. But still showing due. A useless application. You need customer care support to apply, now if you pass the loan, it will take at least four days to appear in the account, if you try to send a complaint, it will not work, if you send an email, there is no reply, customer care support once a day. Now if you get cash, you have to pay the interest from the date of applying for the loan. As per app my amount disbutsed on 09-01-2023 & the same is not yet credited in my account. Many times contacted the customer care & they confirm it will resolve in 48 hours. Now it is 4 days are over & there is no update & ticking system also not giving any update Very worst experience... Their executive representatives call many times before due date and say to pay by link provided by them and after repayment all due amount before due date they did not cancle e mandate from account and hit & bounce charges for it... In my experience I realize that they are only make everyone foolish by it ... Please don't use it to take loan. I never provide it to a best loan service provider..... It’s a great app, It has a really good user interface. I feel it’s the best app for instant student loan. If you are looking for a hassle free app for any type of lan this is the one. Don't waste time to download loan app. Because I was sent all ready my data & 24 hours credit account. But I am not received any payment. So I think it's spammy or misused data. I will be suggest don't input your personal data.",grievance,paymeindia.in,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

I was not able to change it. I wanted less tenure. So later i did not take any loan. Only final sign to document was pending. Now am trying to delete all the personal information that I filled but could not delete. When I open the app it's showing all the details. Team, kindly help. Had a great experience regarding credit. They just provide you instant credit in times of need. I had just a small issue with connecting them, since the customer support no. provided in the site is old and not reachable. So I tried to contact them via mail and within an hour they contacted me back to sort out the issue. Their customer support is also helpful. Just a little suggestion to update the contact no. of yours so that people can contact you easily. Anyways, thanks a lot 😊 for helping me Edit - Got the amount after a day. Thank you so much for the service! Your app claim fast loan approval. Despite of qualifying each and every step, even after setting up the Auto dabit. The amount hadn't been credited or disbursed. I am not sure then ""How is it providing quick service?"" Trying to reach your customer care number as well, but no response since 11:00AM. Plase look into it. I submitted my bank statements last 3 months on single file and seperate statements for each month too and still not going to the next steps always showing pending documents and no help from customer support even after mailed them about the issues still got no reply from team. This is my second time getting loan from this app first time it was smooth and i got 20k loan instantly now it's not even working I hope u guys fix it as soon as possible. Thank you🙏 . I will change the ratings after fixe Thanks for your service, I have received the loan last year. Now I am getting numerous phone calls from your end stating that I can re apply for a topup loan without submitting any documents through the money view app, which is the opposite, because every time I login through the app it says ""pan card already registered please submit a different one"". I have also emailed regarding this,but no reply.I've uninstaled and reinstalled the app many times still the same. please help so I can re apply. I entered all the details to check the eligibility for loan.and I want to change my bank details . I was not able to change it. I wanted to change my bank details . So later i did not take any loan. Only final sign to document was pending. Now am trying to delete all the personal information that I filled but could not delete. When I open the app it's showing all the details. Team, kindly help. After putting the necessary details for the Top-Up Loan Amount, when I put the OTP to Sign the Loan Agreement then it will show 'Please Enter Valid OTP'. Kindly, rectify it. I also uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Still showing the same problem. Edit (25/01/2023) My grievance is resolved. But I got my Top-Up Loan Amount within 8 hours, anyway they mentioned that the amount will be credited within 24 hours. They need to work on the time required to disburse the loan amount. I have a very bad experience of while filling the agreement form ( sign agreement ), no matter how many times I fill in the OTP it will always say Invalid OTP. On top of that, the agreement form is not even showing up inside the app. It leaves a lot of questions in my head of the security and functionality of the application itself which is getting the basics wrong. Sometimes earlier the app gave a message that ""it cannot connect to the server"". I have paid my first loan but while I want to take a second loan , this message popped up and hardly I could do anything. But now with the help of the technically sound team from Moneyview , my issue is resolved. Thanks Moneyview, I got a second loan 🤓 It's not fastest and easiest loan app. I've been trying for 2 weeks. I submitted the scanned document still I don't have any notification. Worst experience. There is an option for canceling Auto Debit but useless. We must apply for Auto Debit option and manually should print and sign in the document..... It was very nice experience with Moneyview App earlier in 2020. I had been using Moneyview App for more than 2 years for my financial needs. They have provided me loans of big amounts yet and I also had paid all loans on time. But don't know what went wrong I had foreclosed my last loan one month earlier and since then they kept rejecting my loan applications until now. Very very disappointed by this behaviour of Moneyview where I was loyal with them. See, if you feel this is right. Really starting to hate this application. The customer service I guess has stopped working, I don't even hear from them even after consecutive emails to their support. I have had double emi deductions and no one from the support is willing to answer, also the advantage card has stopped working since 2 months am not able to access the card as well. If any one from the team is reading this please update the customer support team to reply to my email. And make sure to fix the app by year end. Very pathetic and irritating tried 16 times to set up e-mandate (NACH) for emi auto debit automatically getting refresh and redirecting to main page and even OTPs not able read by its own, need to enter manually and while copying OTP by myself it is automatically getting refresh. Tried with all options mobile,email and through aadhaar also. They even don't have customer care to assist for this issue. Thanks for the support, Normally people take loan on some emergency, if he did not get that loan on time then after its no use. I also applied for emergency but due to your technical issue it's too late for me. So now I don't need your loan. Again thanks for your support. Need last help from your side, please delete my all personal data from your database. I had a good experience with the app! It is awesome. But recently I got message of Top up loan unlocked and applied for it and it was showing in progress, now all of a sudden TOP up loan offer has disappeared and there is no response from the Team even if mailing Many a times. Truly Amazing experience..... Very satisfactory experience from the beginning till the disbursement , process is quite simple and affordable options available , and the most important part is that they came to my help during my low days and they just won my heart...... After this experience I truly understood the meaning of credit!!!! Thank you so much money view team , at the end I would like to say that please don't roam around for money with other untrusted apps , just try MONEY VIEW. Not fastest, nor the easiest. Slowest it it. They can't even use the technology in right way. I have send them manual nach form and they keep rejecting it. What's the point of providing online services when I can't even setup my auto debit online. It's been 1 week this is happening. No customer support nothing is there to help. There customer support doesn't even care to call and support in the process. It's literally useless. Worth app for emergency credit. I was approved for Rs.10000 which took me short period of time to avail. But for Rs.50000 i have submitted all documents but still no any update & got stucked at verification in progress. Why does it take such a long time for second loan whereas at first i have already given required documents? Any possible reason? For this i'll have to minus 1 more star, or I could rate it 4 star for overall performance. I rarely use this app and credit only at emergency. If I took any credit but within due date I will pay. I don't have any dues even though they have disabled my transactions I don't know why..no proper reason they mentioned. I tried to contact you but no proper response/no proper reason. I asked then to delete my account still they have not. This is rubbish.. I was unwell for a couple of months. I was in great need of money, there was a problem of home expenses and finance to take medicines, then I tried to arrange money here and there but did not get the money, then my mobile.The recharge was also about to end, after that I opened the Airtel app, then there was the option of loan, then I applied for the Airtel loan. And whatever process was completed, they didn't have to pay a single charge and 100% Money received in my bank account by MVL thanks. Disappointed 😞 I uploaded my bank details then checked and it shows I'm eligible for 60k loan. I need only 55k .so I choosed 55k for 12 months . After completing all my personal details. A notification comes and it shows my amount 55k was revised to 5k for 3 months automatically. I can't change it .only one option is I need to confirm. And I can't remove my personal details in it Totally dissatisfied And I strongly not suggest these application to any one ..,,🙏🙏 Nice loan app but it's take some time to fully verified documents and online emandate nach for auto debit emi process. Nothing any problem out of these but now it's easier through support of representatives along with good customer service. It's very helpful to me when uncertain need for money raised. Plus point is there is no manual process to obtain the loan. Loan interest percetage is littlebit higher comparing with other online loan apps. But the processing fee is reasonable comparing with other. My recommendation is to reduce the loan distribution time. And also please mention that you dont have any business connection with china. Like you are made in indian. Not happy with the process.. I have applied for the second time, and after all the process completed the app showing still 'in progress' for disbursement. I dont know what to do.. They are showing the amount will disburse within one business days.. And its almost two days.. And am unable to cancell the loan too.. Team kindly look into it... Its a really serious issue. This is a very good app and very real. ☺️ Total time from start to finish was only 10 minutes.😯 It took less than 1 minute to process.😊 And as soon as the process was done, the money came into the account within 2 minutes.😍🥳🤩 This app is too genuine ☺️ And I am telling the truth with proof 🧾😎 I have applied for the top-up loan and started the procedure but my application got stucked at upload documents. Inspite of number of trails i didn't make it. I tried to reach the customer care support through customer care number and even I have sent mails. But still my problem is not solved and I have not recieved any reply also. Must preferred application. Thay helped me out of all quarries what I'm faced during documention. Thank you Hello why the app is not loading. It always keep on loading forever. The loan status is not showing properly. And why am I not able to verify e-nach online, why do I have to get print out and send it to you. Customer care not reaponding and Amount Of Loan Is Not Credited In My Account. However, when I updated my bank passbook, it did not reflect the cash deposit transaction. Therefore, It is my humble request to kindly check the issues with my back deposit and comes up with a positive feedback. I cannot tell that Money App is the best loan app in the world, because its installment is the easiest. Meaning it is less appreciated than it is. The money view app helped me at the time when I needed it the most and for this I heartily thank the Money View app and its entire team and I also know that this feedback may be fake to everyone and some to more. Like it but I do not know the difference, because there cannot be a better loan app than this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Application shows auto debit will take up 1 minute to complete. But still it is stuck... It has been more than half and hour... How we can trust on this In money view app I have an issue in payments. I paid the amount 05/01/23. But still it's not showing in money view app and I am send a.. 5 mails attached with amount paid report . Money view customers service is Very slow and Not responding . These types of problems are losing a money view customers. 23/01/2023 my money view payment issue cleared . This service is slow but my problem is solved Thank you for money view service. This is a good app for fast and better way for loan in emergency..I have been costomer since last year..i paid my all emi amount time to time. After paid.... the app don't show any option to get another loan for second time..when I will get it give five star to Money View.Thank you it was very first experience and delightful..the money view really works super fast, but dissapointment is the interest, for a 20k loan you get 18k in hand and you should return 24k back! How cool!! Waste of time. I've approved by many personal loan apps like Navi, paysense, kredit bee. But this app shows you're not eligible. Don't go for it.. WORST app. I am not interest to take a loan as amount is too less but customer care executive insist me to take loan. SO finally i apply and it took morethan 48 hours and still pending. NOWADAYS it takes hardly 10 minutes to approve a loan by any loan app. ITS a completely waste of time even call centre executive. I have unstalled the app and also request them to cancel my loan application. THIs app is very old and company is also very much lack behind. I have already send mail to cancel it. While selecting the Bank Name I have selected ICICI instead of Axis by mistake, but when I tried changing the correct name it is not allowing me to change the correct Bank Name. The Bank name button itself is not working.Due to this I am unable to complete the process. Team Kindly help with this.. I selected bank wrong, i was not able to change it what a poor bug. There is no proper customer care service, noone replies how to get rid, why is this app approved to serve and in the playstore is a mistrey. From initially it's showing eligible amount 30k but I have taken five thousand.I have completed it with in 3 months on time , without any penalty or before my due date .But now it's showing eligible for same 5 thousand.How it happens .I can't understand it ..bad experience I have cleared all due then closed app but they called me and asked me to pay emi due after that i checked my transaction history again I saw Moneyview app it was showing over due emi again I paid then checked again it's showing dues.

🏢Address: 16/3 Adarsh Crystal, Jogupalya, Cambridge Layout, Bengaluru - 560008",4.5592546,1019813,"Do not take loan from this app. Firstly, they charge extremely high interest rates. Secondly, they will start bombarding you with texts and calls starting from 7 days before your due date. I mean reminding is appreciated but 7-8 calls per day and 4-5 texts and notifications per day are absolutely irritating even though I have taken multiple loans and never defaulted even one EMI. I will not recommend this app to anyone unless they are your last option in the world. Worse than local moneylenders Pay off the entire loan amount before the stipulated repayment period then they blocked my account, took multiple loans and repaid everything on time, then what's the issue?? Navi is the best app ,no foreclosure interest, EMI is very low ,& fast process. Go for that app.. this became worst app. If you Pay off the entire loan amount before the stipulated repayment period then they lose their chance to make interest on it and that's why they blocked my account! I took multiple loans and repaid everything on time. Now if I chose 3-6 months as the repayment Tenure but end up clearing all the EMIs cause I have the money, then what's the issue?? It's one and only great loan application which I have never seen even I have taken loan with lower interest and this app build our credit score great and disbursement happened instantly such a great app if u people are looking for loan app means don't think just close your eyes and go for it. It's unbelievable Thanks you KreditBee ❤️ $Whenever I needed something for the classroom, it was always conveniently close by. I'm happy to hear that you found value in my assistance, and I agree that going the loan route was the most time- and effort-efficient option.@# In light of your prompt replies and high quality, I really can't think of anything that might be improved upon. 5 stars. If you're in a jam, this tactic might save the day. This application excels in both readability and practicality. Nope, not an app that you can rely on. I've been trying to apply for loan from this from ages. Inspite of getting calls from the team it looks like they haven't been able to resolve the issue. For a team which is unable to resolve it's customer's greviences I believe this is not a right platform for relevant things. This here is a clear example of lack of customer negligence. What's a company which cannot help it's customer's. I was told that I'll get an update and so far didn't see one. I have paid the installment and the amount credited in kredit bee account, but not reflecting in the app. When I tried to file a complaint, the option always pop ups' time out' and I can't register a complaint. When I called customer care executive, he told bank will repay my amount in 7 working days if it is not reflecting in my account in three days. How could I pay on time if refunding takes 7 days. Should I pay fine after? If you want to get loan very easily, just use kerditbee personal loan app. The loan program is realhy good and convenient . There is nothing to be said about the low interest rate . Absolutely loved it . I have taken two loan amounts out of which I have paid both the amounts before the due date. Now, I am being refused another loan even though my credit score is good. This is not only a problem faced by me but various other users as well. Once You Pay 1 or 2 loans, (even if you pay before the due date) they refuse to give you any more loans saying 'we are unable to process your loan at this time due to certain anomalies in your profile or due to bad repayment behaviour'. Very bad experience. One can use this application app to get a loan in an instant with paperless work I love the way it works Must use this application app and The app UI is GORGEOUS Especially in dark mode Well designed, and super smooth. Transitions between screens or options are superfluid. Absolutely a hit out of the park. Oh yeah, it also tracks all the flavor of the day loans you have too💰 If you Pay off the entire loan amount before the stipulated repayment period then they lose their chance to make interest on it and that's why they blocked my account! I took multiple loans and repaid everything on time. Now if I chose 3-6 months as the repayment Tenure but end up clearing all the EMIS cause I have the money, then what's the issue?? i think if we not paid on time then u take high intrest so that u will give loan to that type of customers very un satisfied service i never seen.. Very bad experience. They don't have foreclosure option. Once take a loan to continue emis. Before you have money to pay total amount with interest. You want to close please pay total amount with interest. Number of times i will send a mail. But they are not given any option. Customer care number is working. Number of times i am calling to customer care but not response. You don't have any loan. Send a mail but they are not contact close the ticket If we have to close the loan account earlier.. We have to pay all months interest amount... And even they are charging more processing fees.. Very bad experience with kreditbee aap.. Better than this.. NAVI is good app.. No foreclosure charges.. Not extra additional amt.. Only limited interest we have to pay... Worst app. It made very much simple and easier for me to get a instant loan help from this application and it provides smooth user interface and The review speed is super fast, and the entire application process only took me 5 minutes. There is nothing difficult to meet the requirements. This is a well-designed product. If you need quick money, please don’t hesitate to try this application app💰 I serached and found this app amongst many other small loan apps, and I must say, this is THE best app for small and medium loans as and when needed. Easy EMI's, standard interest rates, and quick delivery. The only thing I want to get better is the processing fee, which sometimes takes up to 3-4% of the loan amount. was bit skeptical as my credit score recently reduced due to a loan which I am trying to close but I don't know where to pay as they stopped auto debit from my account. Other than that all my active account has timely repayment history. But kreditbee may have ignored that portion and approved my loan request. although the amount is small, but sometimes it can be very useful. The payable interest and service charges can be justified as they are just doing business. Thanks! Was this review helpfu Working of this application very satisfied me and giving the pleasing performance of this application which brings very easy way to get loan very instantly and Loans without collateral or paperwork. It’s super easy to register my data. They are basic data. I received the money in less than half an hour. That ’s why I gave it 5 stars. Excellent.💰 Very good experience and speed. I am happy with the support staff. they are friendly and quick. I'm a little upset with the documentation and timing. All in all, it was my first very good credit.Thank you, this application team, keep up the good journey. This application is specially well design for giving their user create option to get instant loan services and It is very fast and simple, and I like it. Information such as payment date, amount, and interest payable is clear at a glance. Excellent app, I highly recommend it.💰 Super application for taking a personal loan and the interest rate is also very less that anyone can beat the charges and The service is still good. It is worth recommending a very good loan software for a very useful loan software. Can be repaid in each installment.💯 This is one of the best app which I have experienced in the loan segment,its very flexible to use. The approval very fast and it's very helpful app for your needs. No need extra documents required for loan approvals. I recommend to each and every one to use it if you are searching for any loan. Thank you so much kreditBee, I had an wonderful experience🥰 When i took the first amount i was totally affraid as i had heard many illegal maters about online loan apps, but due to the emergency i was compelled to take from credit bee. But seriously, its such an amazing and so helpful platform for those who are in need for money in emergency cituations. They provide the amount within time and they do 100% what they say. Extremely perfect and reliable application. Thanks and congratulations to all credit bee team... Hope you will continue the same 🙏 When I had crisis I needed to search for online advance applications. However online applications never made me intrigued, I evaluated Kreditbee. My companion suggested me. The application interaction was smooth. Endorsement was sufficiently fast. This application is very fair, taking everything into account.@ Highly concerned with this application app help it always give the missing services and instant help which was really nice and Recommended application, easy to use. Interest is lower than other loan applications. I hope to get more money for the next loan, and I think there is no inconvenience to pay.💰 Well I like this app but their processing fee is very high and in loan disbursal they are deducting Many charges like document fee processing fee credit fee etc... It's all very very high and also they are not providing any coupon too even in festival time.. I hardly will recommend this app.. There are many other better apps apart from this regarding the loan disbursal charges Very bad experience. They don't have foreclosure option. Once take a loan to continue emis. Before you have money to pay total amount with interest. You want to close please pay total amount with interest. Number of times i will send a mail. But they are not given any option. Customer care number is working. Number of times i am calling to customer care but not response. You don't have any loan. Send a mail but they are not contact close the ticket Not satisfied with the app . I have paid all the emi on time but for the one time I was late for only 2 days and they increased the amount upto 100rs . After paying the monthly emi I cleared all my EMI's at a time because I needed money urgently but after paying the hole amount app refused to give loan to me only because of paying 2 days late. And it's intrest is more and processing fee is also very high . Waste of time and it's give the silly reason that to avoid the late emi payment. Probably the best instant online loan application in India. Simple and easy application procedure which takes only 2-3 minutes. Instant approval and disbursement, no hidden charges, lowest interest rate and a practical and easy repayment options. All these things make credit bee the best online loan application. Hats off to the entire Credit Bee team. It was such a helpful and appreciate all application which always giving the great work and amazing services to get fastest loan approval from this application and A friend recommended this application app to me. This is certainly a very good experience. I got the loan through a fairly simple application process. The staff who reminded me to pay on time were polite and friendly. Hope I can get more.💰 Perfect solution for all the users who want to solve their problem by using this application delivered instant loan very quickly and I have taken loan from this application and its really a good experience with this application. And the customer care staff is really humble and speak with team. He is also very polite. Creating a powerful and straightforward user interface (UI) tool for the underprivileged is conceivable (UI). In its own way, this was entertaining.# It's great, I love the whole process, it's very smooth and the customer care execs are also very decent and helpful.Flip Case is a really professional app for developers in the company.It takes as little as 10 minutes Without a doubt, the amount was credited to the account thanks to this many applications. Edit 2/2/23; Hello the app is still not accessible, for sure I'm not going to pay EMI until app opens and don't fall behind your tricky games sending links with penalty very next day which works well. Hello the app is not opening at all, how to make payments, and the link with penalties opening well, what is hell tricky game playing with users Compare to Navi or any other apps processing fee is very high(after one complete repayment of first loan there is no processing fee for all other apps) ,Emi is high.... And number of repayment tenure is too low . no foreclosure option at all This is the fastest loan processing application that has been developed yet and I am very happy that I came to know about it and It is fast and convenient but the processing fee is a bit high and the tenure, if it can be increased that would be better that is the only reason to give 4 stars rest all is very satisfying💯 Excellent, loan process is very easy. They disbursed the amount within fraction of second after veryfying the document. For every other laon provider, it is suggested to keep the process flexible, so that anyone one can access the service. Keep it up @KreditBee and thank you. Simple way I’ve used this application which provides me just outstanding experience in this application and I have taken instant loan help from this application app and It’s just awesome, loved the overall process, it’s very smooth and customer care executives are also very decent and helpful, flip case is a truly professional app hat-off for the developers of the company. It took less than 10 mins and the amount was credited to my account thanks to a lot of this application.💰 Took all my details and next day they said you are not eligible for loan after 3 months you can check again. Why do you take all the details and take one day to inform the loan eligibility. You can just check it from Pan card and at the same time whether we are eligible or not. You are wasting our time and collecting the data. Please delete the data you have taken. I don't want any loan calls from KreditBee. I am uninstalling this Aap. I had a great experience with kreditbee app.it was the ist time that took a personal loan,,, everything was quick and easy ..&their repayment options were also flexible...i recommend this app to everyone ..the best app for availing a loan during emergencies",help,kreditbee.in,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,change your audio settings full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

At very first a couple of day before they rejected my loan.... but 2 days they messaged Me your loan has been Approved I thought it's just a span message... I was going to delete it but then I thought why not I should try last time and then they just given me 12000 instant loan limit. Very Good and the best thing it's a Genuine This is a fantastic app.Fibe always lends a hand. They can easily get you a loan.Easy and flexible repayment options. Terrible experience. First, no message or notification was sent that when somebody will come for verification, the person directly comes to my house for verification, why would you expect me to be at home at office hours, to top that my mother only knows odia, i told this problem to this guy who had come for verification. Second in app it says KYC pending, but i had already done KYC. Let's say it is not done, in the app there is no way to find that KYC option. It is well hidden treasure.Horrible I have paid all your EMIs on time and I have been using your app for the past 5 years. Now when I need a loan due to an emergency I'm apparently ineligible for a loan from Fibe cause of internal criteria. I am really not happy about this and i will never use your app or refer Fibe to anyone. PATHETIC!!! Never Go in such app like Fibe They asked you all the details and will not approve your loan amount. I afraid because I had choosen Net banking for my bank statement after submitting net banking details yet They haven't announced loan amount by saying your eligible because of internal Criteria. Bad Application Totally Time waste if you wanted to save your data do not applied anything They asked. Worst app don't have the capability to provide loan. Don't waste your time access some best apps better than this one. Totally waste of time. Worst Service Provider I have ever seen. They won't close the loans even after full repayment with multiple follow-ups. I am following up fro August. There is customer service for this app. One email ID is to mail the query/complaint. For each mail we will get a ticket ID. That's it. No more replies or no solutions. If you reply again you get one more ticket ID. Please don't waste your time by downloading this app. This is an excellent app for our requirements. I used a Fibe Credit credit. It's incredibly basic and straightforward, and there are no hidden costs.You can receive a credit right now using this app.Impressive instant loans when in need. e-NACH can't complete. When i upload the picture of the firm it shows error. And i can't setup UPI/Credit card option trough payment. Taking more photo copy of e-NACH form. Worst experience.. Still my application is pending. Is it instant personal lian application🙄.. If the e-NACH process not working u should create the other options... Otherwise its wate of time and my data are not secured. I found it really annoying because I paid all dues on time, when I tried Taking a fresh new loan it says I am not eligible for no reason. How a person who paid all EMIs on time could be not eligible for another loan.. very annoying.. not worth trusting this app.. and even the loan history is not updated, it shows the loan is still active. Work on improving it.. it was a way better when it was early salary.. now it looks more like a waste app. I wasted a lot of time waiting for the next loan. Using this app is easyA great credit limit. Fantastic easy personal loans through Fibe.Simple and adaptable repayment choices. It was one of the best app in terms of taking quick loans however it has become worst. I have been taking loans from this app since 2019 but they do not care about the customers anymore. I do remember that the early salary used to provide an option to change the EMI date if we are making an early payment but the option is not available anymore instead they are harrasing me by calling 40 times in a day. Godawful It's just awesome. You can trust them. As per my personal experience, Customer care personnel are very helpful and dedicated towards their work and a very easy credit facility of your approved loan amount instantly. Also interest rates are not much high, just bearable. High interest rates and processing fee. Always late update of payments you made. The app even dont work properly. Everything again and again supposed to upload manually. Not a good option to go. This app also take unauthorized access to your contact list. Useless app please don't waste your time. Uploading documents is very difficult and no help is available. My EMI due date is 4th of every month. I have set auto repay but the EMI amount did not got deducted from my bank account, whereas I have more than sufficient balance in my bank account. I am trying to pay from the Fibe app but in every repayment method it's showing 'Payment failed' immediately after click to any option or its showing some error. It's even showing Rs 500 as my non repayment charges, but it's not at all my fault. I am still unable to pay my EMI, so it might charge fine again. The loan term is three months, which is ideal for the users. Many apps are only available for a month or a week, making it difficult for users to pay in one go. Within seconds of applying, our loan is reflected in our account. If you're seeking a quick loan online, Fibe is the place to go.You can use the software to keep track of your expenditures and check your credit score.Fibe is offering a quick loan right now! I wish I could give zero stars. I've been trying to close my account since I've repaid all the loans but I don't see any option to close the account on their app. Neither did I get any response from their twitter handle. These cos are a menace if you want to keep your credit history clean. They'd never close your loan account even after you've closed the loan. Don't avail their loans. A fantastic app.Before I instantly received a good loan amount with no additional work, I had no idea getting a loan could be this easy.Pay loans with an EMI. Worst app.. Even after making the payment in the bank account amount was not updated and bounce charges are applied and amount debited by this app and also through bank. I had to make an extra payment as no resolution was given to close the loan of salary card. Amount still not updated even after multiple reminders. I onlt got a response as they could not find the payment in their bank account. Good features on the app. One of the best loan payment app. Its simple and quick this was. The most efficient method.One of my favorite apps is this one. The app has five stars.Simple and flexible repayment options. Fibe is easy to get loan.The rating has been increased to 5 stars once more because I think this is the best loan application I've seen thus far.Best free personal loan app. Great app, it's really simple to receive a loan amount, and it does a fantastic job.As quickly as feasible, obtain a virtual credit.Super Instant Cash. To the very core Within 10 minutes of starting the application procedure, I had a credit amount in my account. Excellent really, very impressive Approval came in quickly. It was fantastic.As quickly as feasible, obtain a virtual credit.Instant cash loans. Fibe always there to help its customers. I was in need of a personal loan from a competitor because I have been unemployed for 5 months. I did extensive research and found out that the rates were high but it's overall convenience outweighed the cost. However, when I went to apply for Instant Personal Loan, they had such amazing offers that some of them almost tripled the rate of my competitor! The Instant Personal Loan app is so easy to use. I was looking for a quick and easy way to get some money before payday, but all of the other Apps that offered payday loans were too long and complicated. The Instant Personal Loan app was perfect, they had it all set up in under ten minutes. The Best personal loan service provider. I had been making late payments on my personal loan for the past few months and my credit score was getting worse. After contacting Instant Personal Loan App, they helped me come up with a plan to get back into good standing. I have applied for a loan 3 days ago and it just keeps showing money transfer in progress. I was not able to call customer care as the number they have provided is invalid. I have always cleared my dues on time and still I'm getting treated like this. What a terrible experience this is. I thought I could trust Early Salary to get quick loans. The status has been on pending since 3 days. Will not use the app again. It's not always easy to get a loan quick, especially if you don't have a steady income and you're already in debt. I was able to borrow Rs5,000 with the Instant Personal Loan App! It has been so easy to use and they have helpful support staff who are always there for you. I was in need of a personal loan urgently and needed the funds right away. I searched for personal loans online but I wasn't sure about the rates and legitimacy of these Apps. I found Instant Personal Loan App on google, read through the reviews and decided to go with them as they seemed legitimate. The loan application process was super easy and fast, and I got approved quickly! Instant personal loan app is amazing. I tried looking at other sources but they were so slow and complicated. Instant personal loan app took care of everything, and I was able to do it quickly. It's a great service. I had an emergency, so I searched for a loan that could help me out. After scanning through the different lenders and reading the different reviews, I decided that Instant Personal Loan app was the perfect choice. I was looking for a personal loan and this Appcame up. I was so amazed that it was reasonable and easy to get. I felt like the best personal loan website, but I knew my credit score wasn't in top notch condition. That's when Instant Personal Loan App helped me better my borrowing situation and even help me save money with some other features. I was in a difficult financial situation and my credit scores were low. I knew I needed to borrow money, but was hesitant to have it in my name again. Instant Personal Loan App made the process incredibly easy and quick. They offer private loans without credit checks, so there's no need for collateral. Worst service ever This is the second time when I applied for PL and as per the eligibility criteria I fullfill every requirement. I was trying to upload PDF format bank statement is shows error, I mailed them still it shows error, after some time it shows you are not eligible for this time please try after 3 month. I recommend don't use this app I am a salaried professional and I needed a personal loan urgently. There are so many lenders in the market and it is difficult to choose one. I went through Instant Personal Loan App and stumbled upon an offer that suited my needs and budget. They made the application process smooth for me, all I had to do was submit a few documents. The best part is that they processed the loan on the same day! I would recommend this App to anyone who has been looking for a personal loan I received an instant personal loan from the Instant Personal Loan App. I was having a tough month and needed money fast. The transaction process was fairly simple, but most of all, I liked that they were transparent about the appraisal process. I needed a loan for my business from the bank. Every time I tried to get some money or a personal loan, I was rejected because of my credit card debt and the rates they were offering me were outrageous! I found Instant Personal Loan App through Google and was so thrilled with the rate. It's worth it - I'm so glad that now I can start making progress in my business.",help,fibe.in,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,change your audio settings control vibration full network access pair with Bluetooth devices prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections Access all system downloads receive data from Internet,0

Contact: hello@moneytap.com",4.058316,343285,"Very bad customer care and support. Been one and a half months now and still I am stuck on e-mandate. There is no customer support that you can reach from your end on call. Even the email ID they have provided is useless because it's been 4 weeks, i have sent almost 10 - 12 emails and there has been no reply. I would strongly recommend users to do MoneyTap's background check before applying. It could be a fake application. Best App used to be superb. Then something went wrong. It just keeps getting worse and worse now with every update. Lots of bugs that are never fixed. Extremely slow loading of songs. Not user friendly at all. Sound effects were good then became very bad. And it doesn't seem like they listen to any feedback. Looks like they're giving up on this or something. Nice.... worst experience so far. There is no support number to call them. i tried the money transfer feature. the transfer hasn't gone through and charge is already showing up on my credit card. the credit card transactions are not showing up on the app. seems very shady / incompetent. Update: The issue is still not resolved after 10 days. Even my mails are not being answered. It has been the worst customer service experience. I'm experiencing login issue for almost a month, which I've reported via email to the support team. I've received the first response after 2 weeks asking me for the screenshot of the error and the last email received was 4 days back providing troubleshooting steps which did not work. I've replied to that email twice and there has been no acknowledgement as well, when the issue is on going since 31 March. I wouldn't recommend this app. Very bad experience. I don't think this app is legit. I filled an application and was quickly moved to a ""Waiting for Televerification"" status. But after that, it's been more than a week and there has been no calls from their side. Customer support is non existent. They have 1 email ID where you can file a request. I was contacted by 2 different support executives, Bharat and Nalina, both asking me to do the exact same thing. Which I did, twice. Both haven't responded after that. I am unable to transfer amount nor I am able to add beneficiary details. It always takes me to a blank screen and there is no support and customer care. It is very annoying and as per the other reviews also I face the same kind of issue. Why dont you guys fix the issue ? Although the service is good. But I'm giving three star because you guys are irritating me by calling and sending reminder again and again. When the EMI is set to auto debit on a specific date then why are u disturbing by calling and messaging 3-4 days before the due date. Just 1-2 messages are enough to remind. Worst app.... No proper customer care.... I paid all my emi on time still they reported to credit bureau that I have not paid on time and when I raised a ticket to check their customer is not replying at all. I want to negative rating Downloading this app means taking risk with your credit score Worst app. Inspite of payment from the app they keep sending ECS to your bank account. And get double charges. So late in updating their software and when i have written to them no one is bothered to reply to my emails. They keep sending notices from their legal team DMI Finance to threaten you. Better not to take loan from the app. This is very poor and bad performance of this company. I will not recommend this app to be installed or loan to be taken from Moneytap. Even not supposed to provide the requirement after paying deduction the installments with in time. I hope choosen wrong thing. I didn't get any response from this APP through mails & calls also. However there is number of follow ups during pre-due's. But there is no support during requirement. Absolutely useless. Been using it for over a year and paying on time however since last 3 months I am unable to transfer funds. Same error and same response from customer support. That is why I changed my rating from 5 to 1 useless App, there is no proper view for my loan history and repayments done... no transparency on loan history and payment completed. It's been more than 6 months and still this option has not been added properly. FYI, I have updated the application already There is no proper information or service provided by the customer and even if we mail regarding any requirements or questions they don't even answer or get any rply due to more attempt of notification to danks for auto debit my account bank is charging nearly 2000+ amount no proper service and helpline from money tap please don't use this and make sure that it will be not be auto debited Worst app I can't see this type of app.....they take money with high rate interests and they automatically cut out money from bank it's auto debited from our account....and penalty charges heavy and bank aslo cut RTN charges from our account..... it's my humble request to everyone don't trust this app and don't take lone from this app .....worst experience....no customer support..... My worst experience while using this app I have paid my all emi before due date still showing late payment I have complaint many times but not giving me properly answer my credit score decreasing every month because of their fault where can I compliant to higher authority please don't take loan from this app. This is a fraud app.. please guys don't install this app...I installed this app and apply for a loan ..loan amount credited in my account...but unnecessary amount debited from my account for no reason...when I called coustomer care or moneytap staff there is no response no reply...soo guys be aware before install this app very bad experience... i hv to give 1 star 0 is not option....Worst aap dont install the app totally time wasted..all emi cleared....sended messages u r eligible for loan when open the aap showing 5000 limit .then i proceed to taken aap showing after 3 months... Very poor service no response ... hopeless fraudaap... I pre-closed my loan almost months back. App still shows my available limit is 0. And not letting me re-apply. No contact info as well. Quite pathetic. It is one of the worst loan app..too much of extra charges..while taking loan itself they almost deduct 1k.. now i am trying to pay it.. still there is a charge...i too much of extra charge..before taking loan it was showing no extra charges.. i am really very regretful.. and also there is no call option to talk with cx support.. Excellent digital experience. But curre.tly not working It's been a year and my credit line is still blocked Rating from 5 to 2 after an year due to so many problem with the app and unresponsive behavior. My previously used limit was paid completely and I see full limit. Got app notifications to try withdrawal in case of need. When I am trying now, its showing technical error on transfer page. Either the app is wrong or you guys are still figuring out how the automation should work. Don't show something which is not going to get done. The best loan app ever, u get money in just 1 min into your account, it deserves five stars but i ended with 4 as if you miss a single emi they will make your day hell by frequently calling and watsapp messages... Good and very cooperative customer service... Immediate response ... If you pay properly they will provide you with better top up card without any cost with low interest rate. App is asking for upgrade, once updated. Same error, unable to open the app. Also there is no customer support number to clear your issues/doubts. Only mail customer support , I have been raising concerns through email. Same response from customer support. This app is not reliable support for customers. I am totally disappointed. Share concern and get same response ( we are working hard). Adding new review after another 1yr. Worst experience. Seems I got stuck with this app. This is trap worst experience so far. There is no support number to call them. i tried the money transfer feature. the transfer hasn't gone through but the credit card amount has consumed transactions are not showing up on the app. seems very shady / incompetent. I have raised a querry still chasing from 5 days. Not yet cleared the issue I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. Transactions history doesn't show in this app, no support contact number, your amount gets deducted but in the app it only shows only half the amount paid. I've mailed to the support team in which they asked for screenshot and I've provided it but I never heard after that from them. Rating from 5 to 1 after My previously used limit and I have available limit also. Got app notifications to try withdrawal in case of need. When I am trying now, some policy issues and some kind of errors. Either the app is wrong or you guys are still figuring out how the automation should work. Don't show something which is not going to get done. No customer support when you are facing issues. No number to contact them. I have written lots of email regarding the same but the issue is not resolved. I am facing this issue since last 5 month. I am not able to use my available credit limit. When I am trying to withdraw it is showing your withdrawal service is disabled. I am paying EMI on time and I am very loyal customer since last 2 years. Very bad experience with customer support team. very poor customer support services. My rating is zero Very poor and bad customer support, I paid my all dues still they are raising auto debit from account and also customer support team is not responding on repayment updation. I paid all my dues on time since I opened a credit limit. However today when there was a need, i can't withdraw from my own credit limit. Apart there is no customer support number. I need someone to please look into the issue and call me back. Rating from 5 to 1 after My previously used limit and I have available limit also. Got app notifications to try withdrawal in case of need. When I am trying now, its showing technical error on transfer page.in twitter suggesting clux capital loan but no use as ondate, Already mail sent twice no response from your side While applying loan app showing loan emi amount is 5k but after amount disbursment, EMI amount showing more than 7k. 20 k they taken processing fee, it's too much . I was applied 1.75k , but they transferred 1.55k after all dedications. App is too slow and strucked always. I am asking arrange callback, but no one replied Worst app and worst customer service. When ever I send an email they will say we need to review profile again as per RBI and they won't review. They will send only automated emails. I have limit upto 1 lakh but not able to use it. Worst app Amazed so far , using this app from last three to 4 year ,keep your services good ,just one thing you should update credit limit as per the usage,i use this frequently and paying on time no late pay no skipped emi so limit should be good enough which is very low so far Don't download and give any personal details to them. I gave my personal details and I have done e mandate also. But after collected all my details, I could not able to withdraw money. They are telling imps account disabled. But in app, my account number and ifsc code also noted there. It was cheating.... So don't download it.. Very disappointed with this app , plz don't download ,once you will complete one loan ,then is of no use ,you cannot transfer approved money after completing previous loan on time payment. Plz don't download also very high interest compare to other loan app App is not updated, all my closed loan shows open in app , also payment paid updation also not happening. My last paid shows may 22 . We are in Jan 2023 . Some repayment history option not seen says due to rbi guide lines some of app option not available. Very bad app updation There is no proper customer support. I have got approved my loan amount but it was unable to transfer to my account due to technical issues of the app. Totally fake app. Every time they send you message you are eligible. After installing they shows you're not eligible. What a shameless support team you have , i am reviewing this app again and request to everyone please don't use this app for any emergency fund else you will not be able to get rid off this and closing a credit line will become next to impossible thing for you Customer support is to much hard in this application. There is no contact number and also team is not responding for mails as well.But for recovery they will call continuously.",hello,moneytap.com,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

And here it is. Loan process will take quickly or entire day depending on your availability. Obviously Interest rate are high as compared to banks, but not getting help from bank that's why i am at play store for help. I just hope there won't be any issue on repayment part. I have read so many reviews which is stating that EMI is paid but not updated in system. The same is happening with me. My 1st EMI paid before 3 days of due date. But it is not updated in system. Now it is showing panel amount pending 19 Rs. Very disappointed with poor application and services. I have sent so many mails regarding very slow service. But no improvement till time. What is the issue for such a delay to update in application since starting? I have my loan repaid with all the EMIs , and have double checked with my bank with all the 12 EMIs repaid, yet i am receiving the threating message to go for legal action and harm my cibil rating. I have read lot of reviews here and many are complaining on the same, its not our problem if your tool doesn't update with the payments. My loan should be foreclosed now. There is no customer care number to reach out.. ITS A SCAM ! Anyone can reach out to me i have all the necessary proofs. I have foreclosed my loan and paid the amount of foreclosure with the charges and everything. Its been a week I asked the team to contact me. They have sent a link and directions to pay the amount. I have already done that. Now it still shows that I have a due EMI and the loan is still active. This is not the right way of doing things. There is no number to contact them. While taking the loan they have contacted multiple times and when I requested for a call back, there is no one to call me. The loan application and approval process was quick and hassle free although the disbursal is taking time. Emailed the support team but I don't know how long it will take. There isn't a proper customer care support to help you with the last stage. If this can be worked on it might be worth 5 stars. Black maler they are taking contact list while login and they calling to my family contacts even though I have informed for the sam.Even there is no customer support.Even after sending the mail doing the same. After rasing a query upworrd team member connected and he said it was done by third party vendor it won't be happen again but my question is how they have my contact list without your permission. I'll complain against this. I am forced not to give 5 stars only becouse of the loan disbursement process (takes too much time upto 10days). I love the customer support, easy KYC, and the tenure available. Thanks Upwards, cheers. I was approved of some limit but there is no message saying how to disburse it to the bank and there is no contact information. Hope you will contact me once you see this review and it would be very helpful if you did Thank you I am very happy with the functionality of the easy loan application to get a quick loan and my experience with Upwards loan app has been excellent. I'm unable to update my DOB for initial login process. Tried many times by re-installing the app but no use. Kindly return to fix it. Good one but you guys need to do the proceedings quickly and more faster, since you took nearly one and a half week. Before due date I have paid but still you are continuously sending the message. All worthless fellow and worthless organization. Poor systems don't able to update. From past 2 days, it is showing that your loan is approved and will get disbursed shortly and even after processing every step contacting their number of staff and providing all the confidential details still i have not received my amount. Please do not fall in this trap. Dear team, I had applied loan on 1st January, till today yet to get an update on the process of loan . Last week i received mail for pending documents, even after sending documents i couldn't get an update. Team dontbe needful. Earlier I dint face such delays. Would get update within a day after apply the loan. Very high quality platform for getting instant loans and this is truly one of the best lending apps I have had for handling instant personal loans. Editing previous review. I gave got 45k approval and I was waiting for one day fir disbursement. Today again when I checked app, it was showing rejected!! Please stay away from this app. If it's emergency or urgent need, don't depend on this app at all. Never going to recommend this again for anyone. Please go for Navi or Fibe. DONT EVER APPLY HERE!! Really it was poor they are not responding to client mail even though I'm sent 10 mails nearly but not getting any respond. I had closed my loan but still in app it was showing in active status not getting proper response from the team really unsatisfied with this. I have mistakenly clicked the foreclosure option in the app.i get the foreclosure payment mail .in the attachment shows 133000 but in the payment link shows 225000 ...wat is this am really disappointing...it was mistakenly clicked the option.but totally my loan only 149000 ...i need help I have sent many mails no response from them I have paid my all my EMI's but still their legal team sending an email stating there is an overdue. Note: After paying all the EMI's and the loan status still active but I don't know reason why. I have wrote an email regarding this to them. I am still waiting for my amount to get disbursed from last 3 days. Agreement already created but didn't received any call back and amount yet. Even mailed on your grievance ID but no one is listening. This is quite depressing for me. Pathetic app. Not customer support section.... i paid the emi 2 days ago and yet it has not been updated and you guys are constantly messaging and calling me..... even after sending you guys a screenshot of the same via whatsapp, mail..... i feel like made the mistake of the year... will have to bear this till i pay off the loan Loan already closed and still getting the emi bounce message and email. No support number is available for resolving the problems. Waiting for NOC of loan which was already paid 1 month ago. Worst app very bad customer support team. Mentally harsh by calling again and again share the same details with so many times. Please stop this and other wise I have to take another action I would have been giving zero if there were be an option to do so. Upward have hacked my contact list and calling people to them. I lost my job last month and asked upward to wait for a month or 2 so I can again start paying regularly. But they don't even bothering to listen. Do not use it. The service I've gotten from the Upward Loan app is just too great, taking only a few minutes to provide immediate help to users who can get their loan approved quickly. All the functions are awesome and like minded with my cellphone for getting quick processing of loan and I am sincerely inspired after the usage of this exquisite app. BAD. Loan amount and documents got approved but still amount has not been credited past 2 days. If any emergency,do not relay on this application. Very intuitive interface in this application for getting quick processing of loan and it is very easy to use this amazing application. If anyone is looking for a personal loan, we recommend trying the Upwards Loan app as this is the easiest and fastest way to get a personal loan. It’s just amazing to have this application for getting instant loan approval services and I haven’t faced any type of issues while using this wonderful app. Using Upwards loan app has been a pleasant experience for me and I am impressed with the real functionality of Upwards loan app for personal loan processing. Upward Loan App - Instant Loan App is a very perfect loan application for those who have an instant loan. Thanks for the upward loan app. They offered me a loan in one day. I recommend it to everyone. I was really amazed by the features of the Upward Loan app and found it more suitable and convenient than any other platform for processing personal loans. I really don't know what to say about the upward loan app, but I really want to say that it's a helpful app that really provides financial help. Worst app, taking more than 30 minutes to complete all process, at the next second showing rejected. Can reapply only after 3 months. This is only for data collection. Waste of time. Please don't download, it will loose your time and share all documents to unknowns. In fact, this is a nice and interesting loan application and a full-featured app that offers an amazing user interface that is easy for users to use. I think it's the best loan application for everyone, finding the process easy and always providing great service. You will never find a problem with the Upwards Loan App. This is a great and useful loan application and specifically the upward loan app is designed for getting a loan.

Dear Playstore, kindly remove this kind of fake app from from your application base./ Third class customer support, As they said send us the details on mail, It's been 8 days to sent all the required details, but still no one replied on that mail. Why the creditline is not activating after proceedings with all the required details? I have applied for the loan and the loan amount has been disbursed to my account but I can't see the option to repay only I can see is a blank screen. Please do something for this issue because of this problem I can face the problem of late repayment charges . The simple and perfect app for instant loan . I don't understand why the rating is very less for Privo. I applied today and I have received 20k without any salary slip and bank statement. The paper work is simple and genuine. Thank you privo team Totally time west I got senction letter of my loan then I just add my Bank account then app shows that your application is rejected. You guys just collect peoples data frud app never trust again. It was quick and easy to get loan. But it is very difficult to request changes related to bank account and auto debit. My old bank account has been closed and I have reached out several times to get help to change bank account. I am told to make manual payment but whenever I make manual payment through app it does not go through and the money also gets debited. I have been charged late fee again and again due to this. I just need to foreclose the loan now. This was like a bullet train, i have sanctioned a loan from Privo within 15 minutes without any processing fee or other charges the whole loan amount is credited in my account. I have applied at few other portals also but they are just wasting their time in this digital world. Go ahead with Privo if you have good credit history in past. Worst experience they message you that your loan is pre approved. When you install the app they do not sanction the loan. Only data collector. Worst app It was just a text message for loan initially. I thought it to be a scam app. But when i downloaded it and fill the details they instantly gave me a sanction within 5 minutes. It was all paperless but the goof up i faced was in uploading the banking but it was also resolved in no time. This is very for loan emergency but very high interest, before app download show 14% interest but after download app show interest 39.99%,, & and amount show 2lakhs but after app download show 15k, so this is very bad App is very basic and clean. It was straitforward and within few steps i got my first offer. I was looking for a credit line because i got rejected for credit card application. I can withdraw cash easily because the money from a credit line app is deposit on my bank account. Its showing 2 lakhs credit line approved for me but i'm unable to activate,its showing keep on loading while clicking on submit application Hey folks, i got a promotional message for an instant credit line creation though I was not in immediate need I tried this app and it gave me a sanction in no time. Oy draw back is it is not supported on IOS so I had to use another Android device to avail this. Over all a smooth experience Process is very smooth and fast but only 1 drop back they are sending message for higher loan amount after applying they not give 50% also of loan offer amount otherwise it's awesome app. If it's like that than in which basis you guys are sending pre-approved message to customer Hey folks, i got a promotional message for an instant credit line creation though I was not in immediate need I tried this app and it gave me a sanction in no time. Oy draw back is it is not supported on IOS so I had to use another Android device to avail this. Over all a smooth experience I applied instant loan and submitted all documents required digitally with in 5 minutes my loan amount is disbursed to my account.My credit score is good and I pay all my dues on time but my credit report has multiple loan requests even though they approved. App is easy to use and There are NO hidden charges and interest is low compared to other loan apps and also secured .Thankyou Hi, this is a wonderful app, this platform provides paperless loan facility with in 5 minutes, without any headaches, user friendly and simple process. I got my loan amount credited to my bank account immediately when I completed my process, usually it takes less than 10 minutes. Thank you team. It was very quick and easy to get loan through this APP compared to other apps whole process is very easy & fully digital. During the process of my loan application Mr.Suraj helped me for some queries & completed Video KYC for my application. After the verification amount got credited to my account instantly. Overall process has been completed in less than an hour such a great app with no hidden charges. I really appreciate efforts and process. Kudos to Privo 🎉 I initially got an offer of 250000/- but it got changed after completing the entire process. However the final amount approved for me was 187000/- which was not close to my need but the only app who helped me availed some loan in my crucj and that too in 3 hours. If they could have given me the 2.5 lac as per my requierment i would have rated a 5 star as my amount has decreased i would rate it to 4 star. When I login the app they are saying your location is not services able this is one of the froud app. They are only collected data of people's so, I giving 1 star 🤬 haramkhur sale Simple and super fast. I experienced a hassle free loan disbursement without any documentation and calls. Though the interest rate some what high that's ok no problem flexible tenure upto 5 years with no processing fee and no head ache of calls from sales team. Its a great and standard, instant loan app which helps customer in need but i have a one request and suggestion is that if they could provide the borrower to paypending EMi . Loan amount in one go then it would be great. So it is recoomended for the customer who is looking for easy & hassel free loan. This app and the company uses illegal promotion means, even though I have not used their app or signed up they somehow got my number and checked my eligibility. Got an instant credit line offer. Very smooth experience. Worst application. After taken personal details showing this area is not serviceable. It's a good app. They helped me at the time of my requierement.I was in very much need of money when i was refused by my frinds and colleagues.I was afraid to take loan from an app due to high ROI and data privacy but some how they managed to put up to my expectations.it took me a day's time to avail a loan but it was worth waiting, though the communicaion could have been better. I AM UNABLE TO SIGN UP IN YOUR APP EVERY TIME THEY SHOWS TRY AGAIN LATER WHAT IS THIS AND YOU SEND SMS THAT YOU AVAIL OUR SERVICE IN JUST ONE TAP PLEASE UPDATE YOUR SERVICES FIRST AFTER THAT SEND THIS TYPE OF TEXT TO CUSTOMER VERY POOR RESPONSE..... I got a line approved for 2 lacs but i was in need of 50 thoushand for medical purpose and it helped me withdraw the amount i required but the irritating thing was multiple calls to woithdraw full amount. If this is improved then i think over all the service is exceptionally good as it helped me sort out things that I wanted to. Very good loan app. I searched a lot of app. But this app is super. Also they provide zero foreclosure charges. They give upto 48 months(4 year) EMI option. Finally, Interested one i got one Lakhs money on my bank account within 10 minutres after I finished application process. Best and easy app to get instant credit, I had a burden of CC dues however this app helped me pay the same and now i can pay the same amopunt in EMI, Loan sanction was a bigger achievement for me and and also the amount offered was high as compared to other app. Kudos to Privo team for helping the one in need I was very much Reluctant to use this Privo App. for securing my Personal Loan as I had read very much negative reviews about this Loan App. on Google App. I was very much worried to part with my Bank details. But to my Surprise my fear rested once and for all. My Personal Loan of Rs. 1,00,000/- was sanctioned in less than 10 minutes. My Loan was Sanctioned in less than the time I took to fill in the Online bank loan application form. The online Loan process was very smooth and quick. My credit line approved but when I go to withdrawal showing me you withdrawal is in progress very bad service I'm disappointed Thank you Privo for the loan, but i got stuck in Mandate registrations step 3 -4 times but due to hidden customer service support details it took me a day's time to avail a loan.Please try to make the process a little more faster, that would be very helpful. Over all a mediocare experience. I took a loan from privo because i wanted a loan from an RBI regulated nbfc. I was approached by Credit saison to open credit line as i had submitted enquiry for loan. I downloaded their credit line app called Privo. I got 5 laks loan. it took sometime to get a loan but the process was easy and i got at good interest rate. for 14% whereas other apps i got for 20% I had initiallt showed up offer but after uploading my docs i got a revised offer at a decent ROI of 18.5 %. I got the loan easily in couple of hours hence recommending the same for the service. only suggestion is if they could arrange a part payment and little less ROI for the amount offerd would be a great app. it didnt take too many permissions and also i was told in the app many times that my data is not stored. it is good to take loan from a regulated nbfc because your data is safe which is more imp especially when there are so many fruad apps. Easy to app;y and qucik disbursal process not too lenghty.Only the interst rate i found was on higher side but amount offered was alos high as compared to other's. so i would rate this a good app U made my fu***ng life Heaven.. U r the best app for loan .. I previously underestimated you. But finally when i was in emergency need . U just appeared as a life savier. Many banks I have applied for the loan with a very good CIBIL. but they are simply dragging the process without any update and finally rejecting the application. I wish these banks go bankrupt. .. U are just amazing . thank you so much The apply process was smooth and quick.Got the assigned limit, app works seamlessle.They also have Debit card mode to for registering if u don't want to Login theough Net banking.Over all a decent experience to avail a loan. Was running and calling multiple banks for loan from last 2 week for a good interest rate and amount then got a promotional SMS add.... Still not able to believe that loan is approved after 15 mins of downloading the app..... Thanks a lot.. Everything is good and seamless process as well also it is paperless and do not take physical documents like banks.Only drawback is part payment option not being available for any loan amount, though they claim to have 0 foreclosure charges but a part payment option could of be of help.",support,creditsaison-in.com,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

ZestMoney Privacy Policy : https://www.zestmoney.in/privacy/",4.1174273,210174,"I will give a 4 star rating. Very good app. Very good customer service. You can buy almost anything from the credit limit assigned. But just a small thing is very low limit assigned. Despite a CIBIL score of 790, I have been assigned a low Credit limit which is beyond my understanding. Also, my repayment track record is good but still low credit limit assigned. Otherwise very helpful app to buy on EMI. Thanks. Everything was going pretty well. I made purchases and paid all the EMIs without fail. Then all of a sudden my account shows inactive. Called the customer service but she was dumb enough to understand the exact issue. It's very good app, converts your purchases into EMIs and also let's you choose the time period. But after this issue, I really don't know what to say!! Hi, I got a credit limit assigned but could not activate it. I have been trying to continue the activation process and the app gets stuck on Zest logo animation. I informed customer care about it and they told me the issue will be forwarded to technical team. It has been almost a week and the issue still persists. Please look into it, I'll improve the rating once it is fixed. Thanks. Very shady application. The app doesnot allow to download statement, transaction statement, doesnt send NOC for a closed loan account for months. They mark payments to over due though on time and has ecs clearing and effect your credit score. Beware of them. The only thing they allow to download is loan agreement to show you that your are trapped. Update: There was a grave issue with merchant and ZM team's offer terms/dates. Had to follow up extensively to cancel. But fortunately Asif from callback team, escalated the matter efficiently, got it cancelled, followed up again & patiently provided all accurate information & future process, so that I could re-purchase just in time. Really thankful 👍 App ui is good. But the amount of processing fee charged by them is very high. For 23k emi they are charging 3k as processing fee which is more than intrest. And no prier information is given to the customer about the processing fee at the time of payment. Such a looting app. Wait until u receive credit card or take a loan. I don't recommend ""ZEST"" MONEY TO ANYONE. I submitted my permanent account deletion request. The worst experience i had. Please don't ever install or use zest money. They have no experience in solving any of the customers issues. They are very least bother about the concerns of the customers. They will block all your credit limit even without any reason. I order online i have to pay by cash along with all the emis of Zestmoney. Worst app worst customer service. Worst Company out there! Opening an account with them is super easy and convenient. But the real hell starts when you want to close your account with them. First, they will tell you to raise the request through the app to delete the account, but once I did nothing happened, then I contacted the customer service and I was told that I will get a confirmation mail to confirm to account deletion or reverse the process but I didn't receive any mail. All this happened a month ago, no pending dues fyi. I had ordered something through Myntra two weeks ago but it must have failed due to technical issue even after that it is showing me in Zest money app for payment while I have not received any product nor have I ordered, I am complaining in email and help center since two weeks but nothing is happening . Their services are very useless. you all can understand how their service works. Edit: So despite having 100% perfect payment record, zest decided that I wasn't paying on time or have a poor credit score (it's not BTW) and blocked the balance in my account. I reached out to them, only to get forward canned responses with no actual support. I've had it now. 36-40% interest rates, hidden fees, non updatation of loans in cibil,, I genuinely believe these are a bunch of scammers. Currently have 2 loans to close, after that I'll close account on this awful platform. I was provided a loan of by @ZestMoneyCares @ZestMoney which was financed by @InCredFin. All payments were made on or before time still zest did not update correct data hence by credit score as dropped drastically. Over 3 months I have been following them but no success. Not recommended at all. Very easy to use and looks great. BUT BE CAREFUL..... it spoils your CREDIT SCORE..... 3 of my payment shown as loan and overdue... Even when i had closed them before the last date. Regretting to have used it... Because of this my CREDIT SCORE dropped drastically. The app is good for small credit line requirment.. you can use the credit line for emergency purchase when you are running out of balance.. the repayment are easy & quick interest rate are also okay.. Still exploring other options like loan in store.. Good for short term financial needs..👍 Great idea and nice offers. I have used the service before and worked fine. However the app has become useless now. No in app customer support. I'm facing issue with selfies identification after I tried to log in but it won't upload. I have tried countless times now and have given up. Hence leaving this review. Will rate 5 stars once the issue is fixed. Bad user experience. In the world of OTP based login they are still using login via call or send message. Due to some reason call and sending SMS service is not working on my phone and now I cant login. You do not even have a web hi where atleast I can login and see my transaction details. Have already dropped an email for this so please don't reply saying please drop email. I'm having really poor experience here. Already I have mailed you the details as mentioned above but still you asking 🤨 Horrible to say the least. Installed the app, got a credit line , and did the repayment setup . Once it was done , the app asked a maximum of 24 hours for activation. After 48 hours of inaction , I raised a ticket with the support team- ticket(#1855364) asking for assistance. The lousy team got back to me explaining to set up auto payment, without even bothering to check my present status on the application. Such a horrible experience. I bought a mobile phone from flipkart on no cost emi 3 months on zero percent interst but it was not cleared by the flipkart/zest money about the processing fee amount or % that would be charged by zest money on their site. After the final acceptance amount has been charged by them against processing fee is almost between 4-5 percent, which is a huge amount as compared to other lenders. Also zest money shows on their app zero percent processing fees. I felt cheated by them. Worst app i ever experienced, this is a fraud company, i recomend all not to use use this app . My credit limit got freezes all of a sudden.even i have tried to re activate this by providing all the documents but app got stuck after selfi verification with a white screen. I am facing this issue since 8month but no positive response from the customer support as well Over 1 year now! My account is still unable to use, due to some technical issues I was reported tons of time but no one don't care. When ever I tried to reapply, it says to under review.. but if reopened app then it again asking kyc... It's a kind of loop... Also, one of your support team asked me to delete your autopay bank account then readd to solve this problem, I tried but it's over 8 month.. still that bank account status is deletion in process.. I've already raised a ticket (#2157534) I signed a personal loan and it got disapproved, and then hours later there was a glitch due to which it got approved without my permission! I don't recommend this app at all, I now have to pay processing fees for nothing at all. The support line doesn't help either...there should be a system which says that the loan is under review or something atleast before I starting looking for something else. Better way to purchase expensive electronics through No-Cost EMI. I have purchased two Mobiles worth 55,000 rupees on 8 months No-Cost EMI with 5000 cashback. Zero Processing fee in Mi Online Store. But flipkart and Amazon charging Processing fee even on No-Cost EMI. I have transacted more than 1 Lakh. Customer support is fine. My credit score has improved very well. If it is standard EMI,interest rate is high-36%pa. When it comes to No-Cost EMI don't hesitate to go with it. Thanks to Zestmoney. I got 50k+ credit balance in zest money but still I can't use it because for me it's not showing any option for zest EMI on any E commerce platform, i tried to reach out to zest money customer care but their contact no is always switched off. And i tried to delete my account from zest money but they are not deleting my account too. I guess @zestmoney you should improve your back-end team and customer support.. I don't know why you people just creating new issues everytime. After personal loan approval the loan amount credited after 15 days. And now when I just repay my first installment of my loan amount my account shows ""Your credit limit is blocked"". I don't know why. I always paid my dues on or before the due date but still they are showing that"" due to irregularities in payment ""and creating issues. And the most important thing is when I just put a negative review on playstore they called me. One of the biggest fraud Without showing the processing fee they are forcing customer to sign the agreement and later on sent email stating that you have acknowledged the processing fee. One of the worst app for emi conversion . Processing fee is far higher than the interest if purchased using cc. This is really bad app no on minimum 7 day before im provide all documents but my problem is not finish. This very very bad experience for me in life. I'm pay my money but can't show my credit this is really bad bad experience for me. I'm Timely payment but automatically close my account transaction i don't know what is the reason. I'm trying to customer care number many times but can't properly really. Only give answer don't worry sir within 4 days showing your balance 7 day still running Seriously, I have never seen worst app like this. Because they don't have proper system or procedure. I had an account with my old phone number. Also right now unable to login with email id. Also unable to create new account with new number because my account was linked with my PAN. Zest money saying you can not create an account with your PAN. So I m writing here to highlight my concern as my limit has been blocked, you guys are giving lame reasons about my credit score & payment history. FYI I have a very good score on civil as well as on experien & i never failed in making any payment. My main concern was regarding the number for which I have not received a call & it was disconnected by the agent in the middle of call & i never received any call back . I'll be clearing my due soon, your service sucks seriously Highly dangerous app for you credit score. when I purchased a product through this and pre close the loan this app itself. In app the loan was close. When I checked my cibil score, it was decreases 764 to 678. In my cibil report there the loan was not close and seens that was overdue for 149 days. Please don't choose this app for loan It was the only app that I was trusted loaned. Very simple ways to get a loan. Easy installment methods. Easy way to pay EMI's. Liked everything so much. If you pay your EMI's correctly, lot of chances to increase your credit limit and your credit score. Personal loan also available. I'm completely satisfied with ZEST MONEY. The interest and cash back offers take ages to reach you!! I haven't got the cashback yet!! And their customer care experience is just a pain 😞 I fell for the offer they provided but now have to write like 10 emails to get something done. I wish I don't use this app!!! What say other users?? I've been using ZestMoney for almost a year. Used it for purchases of INR 50,000+ till now. Now they suddenly blocked my account. I have literally paid all my installments before the due date. Pathetic. No, I will not send mail with further details. Going with Simpl Pay Later now. I have paid all the loan amount before due date. After 3 months i checked the cibil score and it shows that the loan amount which i have already paid is still due. Then I called the customer care and complained about this issue. I was told that the issue will be resolved within a week. Bt it has already been 3 weeks and the problem has not been resolved. I urgently need to apply for a loan and that is when i found that the cibil score is less because of ZEST Money. Works sometime, sometimes not! I tried to purchase a Flipkart gift voucher and everytime the app redirected me to Flipkart website, where no ZestMoney option was shown. I have all the credit limit as available, none of it is used but still! Rating 1 star, for the pathetic experience. Disgusting app with 3rd class customer service. I have been following with the customer team for more than 4 for the cashback of 250/- and these people are not able to resolve it. They are just escalting the issuez dont know thr escalation is happening. This app should be removed from google playstore itself. I have so frustation with this app that I dont want o publically..... I have already sent so many mails to the email. And then only I am saying that the service is worst to none. I have sent almost 28 emails, but no reply. So dont say about sending emails. You are nothing but the big fraud. Total fraud, I have closed my no cost emi loan on 29th August 2022 but still they didn't updated it on lenders account hence it was showing delayed payment and charged extra 218 for it . Because of these people my cibil score is decreasing continuously. I dont remember how many times i wrote to them and called customer care but still no reply.. thanks for your service. I hate apps those promise you something and don't do it. Zestmoney had an offer cashback after 3 emi's but they didn't not credit it as per promised. It's just a fraud app. I interest cashback gets credited but don't believe the offer cashback terms. For the 1st EMI they have provided Interest cashback on time and from next time they are not at all giving that cashback automatically. I have to go and ask them everytime to provide me my interest cashback which will waste lot of customer time and effort. If we forget to follow up everymonth they are not depositing it. Very dissatisfied with this scenario Failed transactions are reflected in the account as loans. Cx gives fake assurances about clearing it in 10 biz days. A failed transaction from nov is due next week and zest expects me to pay the emi for a failed transaction and they'll reverse it later. I have been following up since november, still no resolution. Interest rates are high and for no cost they charge processing fee which is equivalent to a high interest rate. Avoid BNPL. Must try.. zestmoney is one of the best platform for credit limit & Personal Loan with no extra excuse & charges. If you joined zestmoney no need credit card 💳 of any bank. I very happy with customer service support. I feel nice experience with zestmoney :) Not happy with the decision of removing the gift card section from the app..now I don't know for what purpose should I use it other than Flipkart and Amazon.... and what's the deal with processing fees more than the EMI amount...not happy with this service... thought of recommending it to my friends but now I myself thinking whether should I use it or not.",app-review,zestmoney.in,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,access Bluetooth settings control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections Send download notifications. receive data from Internet,0

Saying there is some error with the credit bureau's end. And I am not able to complete my loan application. Really the worst experience.. I applied for axis Bank credit card Last month,still the application is in Process,Am mailing the support team from past two weeks,only am getting is Atomated Mail reply that's it.. Can't cantact even.. still don't know the Status of my application.. Even I just can't cancel my application.. Worst experience ever .. I never subscribed to any of their service but I'm still receiving spam from them. They don't have a customer care department where you can complaint about it. Before few days ago I applied for a loan but still showing under review in the apk. I send a mail but no one can reply the customer support is not showing any interest wrong apk Worst app I have applied for a loan on last month still it is showing application in process I didn't seen soo much time it is taking for an application don't apply any loan in this This app is totally fake only collecting data they said after 12 hours your loan will be approved but mine is almost 2days they are not responding email no call nothing so please guys don't trust this fake app My initial experience is extremely good. I applied for Personal loan from their website and loan approved from IIFL. Loan disbursed withing 36 hours in my account. India lends customer service is too good, they are very polite and experienced. In my case Vishal G helps during my journey. Thanks. My overall experience is good till now. I am not able to proceed with KYC. It says application under process and redirects to the same page again. Thanks to the app developers Everything was fine but from yesterday only pre qualified personal loan appeared no more step. Realy worst app i got eligibelity from your side but just showng loding logo i try to uninstall and install app again but again loading showing nothing happned.persnoaly i am not recomend this app to any one Very bad experience till now I have applied for a loan 5 days before but till now it is showing prosseing while I have mailed to them but till now nothing response very dissiapionted Quick and easy apply process.User friendly app.Very quick submission. This is a rubbish application, no one gives loan, only submits documents and later rejects,Only collects data, later does not respond and rejects the loan Really sach an Amazing app totally helpful for those who needs personal loan credit card and gold loan Worst app I 've applied for credit card and loan both are pending since decade and they said they will call you for further processing ....please either approve it or reject it and stop playing dirty game to take people's data in the name of laon and cc It's a time wasting app tho. Tried more than 15 to 20 times to get OTP but , this app said always network error guys pls uninstall this not in use to work on , pathetic worst app, it can't get OTP how it can help us funny app Very pathetic system very horrible experience ever in this application.. i applied loan before 1 mnth and approved from 2 lending partners but till now no response while I'm checking the status it is taking different sites and giving ads no customer support also if I ask for call back also they didn't call me back. Don't waste time in this guys plzz we apply loan means we are in emergency situation plzz don't play with us in emergency situation...😓 Very bad app. If you're applying for a loan be ready to wait days and months. The customer service is poor. They just say that issue is sent to concerned department and then you don't get any reply. These are just to steal our information. Don't just get carried away by positive response. I think all are fake response. Thank you for wonderful experience. I'm going uninstall app. Zero star. Worst app ! I eventually sign up and that's it they started to spam me everywhere. I blocked several times they always come with new no. even interacted with there executive to stop . No result!!! Let me clear you!! Even at any cost I am not going to consider your service near future. I am writing here in frustration and I'm going to write the same to all means available. Edited: Issue is still on!! block several no. Getting IVR calls on regular basis. Awesome.... Nice experience immediately sanctioned my loan without any hurdles, charges and interest rate is also very low compared to others. Worst app this not give any statuse it's application on hold always it's shwo same statuse The customer support of India Lends is useless! My experience is bad! But it's a good app for checking cibil score.. Good apps..but req to a loan and give you one month waiting Really wrost app I am applied for a personal loan but applied button not work Verey helpful app we know from this app were we wrong and how to solve this problem and next time we alert Got best personal loan deal from IndiaLends. Took 3-4 days in final approval and disbursal of amount to bank. Faced issue in uploading documents and completing KYC, however support team helped and it was done manually, way faster than i expected. Good support team. Very very worst app, OTP problem, again and again useless app, don't waste your time. Very worst experience. Have applied for the PL twice but there is no response or communication either from app customer care or from the bank officials. It just shows application is under process but whether it got approved or got rejected, I am not at all aware until this current moment, while I am writting this review. IndiaLends even doesn't bother to respond to our mails too. Not provideing loan. My CIBIL SCORE on bank bazar app is 809 but this app showing 719 don't use this app. You will waste your time on this app They do great job. However people might have had different experience for me it was good. I had applied for personal loan and they got it done for me. Thought it was time consuming got the best deal on personal loan. Customer care is also good, they explain you everything clearly. Everything was online and smooth. Highly recommend Me apply for a personal loan but after 18 hours no replay only see the incomplete application so please fast process to my application Thank you Waste of time! Tried to do the credit card application, but when submitting at first it gives a message the income cannot be more than 1,00,000 then it says it has to be at least 2,04,000. No way to actually apply. Really don't appreciate apps which just waste a potential users time. Would have reserved judgement if there had been some customer service, but none to be found in app. Will uninstall immediately. Wish I could remove the download completely. Come on guys a little Q/A would be nice. You will receive texts regarding credit score check, They will ask for many details. After that there will be nothing regarding credit score but you will be bombarded with offers but No Credit Score. Stay away they are just collecting your information. I have tried many times and it was always the same. Don't think of getting credit report by installing this app, it will be stated that only 24 hours time is needed for report generation due to so called heavy traffic but instead the app repeatedly shows us it's portfolio of credit cards and personal loan offers. Worst business model I've ever seen. Update: Your executive responded saying that I don't have sufficient credit history but it was nonsensical in the sense I have around 6+ years of credit history with all institutes I.e. CIBIL etc. Unable to perform email verification as application will turnoff when clicked on email verification. Unable to perform phone number verification as a popup will come in the bottom of the screen asking to agree Truecaller conditions, but there is no options as such. Application is on hold from 2 days where they claim that result will be given in 2 hrs. Doesn't respond to whatsapp chats, will call or respond only when they want, not when customer wants. Kindly fix the above issues. I filled in all details and submitted the documents as requested. I had recievd a call saying it's for pre approved loan hence I went ahead with it. The agent called and texted on whatsapp on first day post that no response at all. In app my loan says approved continue the further application, but doesn't show any. In browser I opened but unable to fill further, wrote mails with screenshot requesting help on same. They said it's declined what is app showing how is application opening. I use this app to check the cibil score but Recent past I have been receiving system generated calls for loan offers and all. I receive at least 5 to 6 calls every day. This is really annoying. I'm getting distracted in the middle of the work because of these calls. I'm really frustrated!! Hello Team, I hope you understand and fix this ASAP. THANK YOU. BEWARE ! ALERT ! Humble request to everyone do not download this app with the intention of getting your free credit score. Yes they do provide your credit score for free but then you will keep getting minimum 5 spam calls per day for credit cards, loans, etc. Unfortunately I have become the victim now, have uninstalled the app but still getting spam calls. Waste of time.... they won't give you a penny, when you are in urgent need of money.... even your credit score is good (mine is 790 cibil, 820 experian ) even we have a good credit score they will reject... it's a time waste app... they are just making us fools. They will send useless notifications. If possible i would rate it negative. Fraud. Don't signup on this app or website. Don't provide them your details. They will ruin your credit score. Requested them to delete my account and got confirmation from them that account has been deleted. But still I'm getting calls for loan, cards. Means once you signup with them there is no way to remove your data. They'll spam you continuously.",mobile,indialends.com,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,Google Play license check control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping read Google service configuration run at startup set an alarm view network connections receive data from Internet,0

I tried with 2 other devices but still the results are same. I don't know what they are trying to do. This app is totally waste of time and even the customer care is useless. Completely useless app. Please do not use it. This a very Stupid app its stuck with worst Customer service and the product is a nightmare......... After like a month this so called ""HERO"" app states that I am not eligible where as I have put in a concern that the app was stuck with Bank verification and I have wrote them multiple times with the exact issue. However, that issue was not resolved and they have come up with a new update of my eligibility after sending 100s of pre approved messages Hero fincorp had stopped giving out personal loans since a year now. But rather than closing the app, there is a technical glitch while submitting the pictures on the app. So no application can go through. I had taken a loan last year and closed it neatly. Since then when i apply to a new loan, 'something gone wrong"" is all the reasonde i get. I asked my friends to apply and everyone gets the exact same response. No matter the device. I suggest not to waste time. Wish I could add a screenshot. I have tried more then 30-40 times even changed the device but it is stuck on 20 % , whenever I try to click the photo to complete verification it shows something went wrong , also raised the query in customer care and they say u have to change the device . I tried with 2 other devices but still the results are same What excuses they have give is incorrect just wasting time non of this point is correct My credit score is 768, there is no emi going on, I applied in your portal because every time is not working properly mean your app is having problems. I'm capable of paying emi ok. Low Credit Score Delayed EMI/payments for previous loans/credit cards Utilizing too much of credit Limit Applying for too many loans in a short span of time High amount of existing loans as compared to your income The app is stuck at loading page since I downloaded it. After all the documents were provided it's just showing me this page. Uninstalled and installed again no change. Also contacted the support but din get any response. Pathetic experience Very worst service. Here fincorp instant personal loan approval for 1lak. Ihave submitted all the documents they asked for They got all my bank details. I submitted net banking all the details. I have not received any response since then. The app displayed ""Ohh! Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, our request for Mandate registration has been declined by your BANK"". We wouldn't be able to proceed further with the loan request.) It has been like this for the last 10 days. I reached out to customer care via email since that is the only option since my emi was debited twice in January. I have emailed my account statements 4 times! However, there has been no response!! I just keep getting automated responses from your server. Can i talk to a real person for a solution? I have sent it 6 times already!!!! Simple and convenient loan app. Very suitable for everyone to use. Interest rates are low. There are many types of expedited payments. The operation is simple and convenient. Very easy to use and recommended. This application app is a lifesaver for me On rare occasions when the car has a problem or something very unpredictable happens, it allows me to pay in advance. They’ll let you pay upfront as long as you have a consistent direct deposit. A great app for checking bank transactions. Full transaction details are shown end-to-end, but it’s all about the current balance. It was a great experience with this application loan. I will recommend it to my friends and family as well. Thank you Borrowing a lot of money is the best, the loading speed is fast, and it is recommended to share with everyone.

Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, our request for Mandate registration has been declined by your BANK. We wouldn't be able to proceed further with the loan request.) It has been like this for the last 10 days. After receiving all the bank details As mentioned above. I am satisfied with this application app. It is very convenient that the money is credited to your account within an hour after the loan is approved. This is the best app for a amount of money and we recommend this application app for economic reasons. Excellent work phone for each lending team. This app app is amazing and I have no words.

I appreciate it very much. I applied for personal loan through Hero Fincorp app.  I did all the procedures.  E mandate has also been done but after that it stopped at the next window. The app nither provided loan application no. nor application no. I have also mailed customer care but no answer has been received. Very bad app, I will tell everyone not to use this app. This app is full of bugs. Solved an urgent need. A friend and I are using it. Loans are quick. Much easier than other loan platforms. Just enter your real personal information. I find this very user friendly. This application app is still very good.

If you encounter difficulties in life, you should use them. Pathetic application process, filling the work address is a pain, the app won't take the details and the error keeps coming even though i tried 100 different ways and changed my phone. Now don't ask me to email the screenshot or screen recording cos ITS BEEN MORE THAN TEN DAYS THAT I HAVE EMAILED YHE SCREENSHOT AND RECORDING. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP AND WASTE YOUR TIME The app Is a god design. It works fine without any problems. Customer care is quicker to respond. All are good for me, but only one, offer the lowest interest rates for everyone and move to the top position after this application. I have applied for personal loan in August my loan is been approved but my emandate was not done due to some technical issue and I have mailed so many times but didn't get any help. But last week I got a call from your side and i described them my issue and then they sended me a link for offline kyc emandate and it has been successfully but still I'm waiting for my loan amount. It's almost 3 days when i have did it and almost 4 months from approval. So to to say but this the worst service. A great experience with this application. Verification process is simple, but loan payments are quick. No calls , no messages, and hassle-free approvals thank lenders. Thank you very much The process is very easy and quick. Customer support is available and calling contacts is also very good for credit agencies and many others.Nice facility.

The best part was no need to pay any amount up front to process the loan, less paperwork, easy to submit and back end customer support was really nice and official.

They ask you to submit your amount requirement and later on they say that you have to buy a membership worth INR 1499 to process your loan requirement request faster. I bought the prime membership ages back and I haven't receive any updates or offer for my loan amount requirement. Seems like a fraud app genuinely. Don't try it guys. Perfect App..!! This platform gives you fast & hassle free loan process with quite easy & simple steps.. You can also get access of your credit history too.. Impressive.. Recommended to all for use this app.. This is awesome app for loans. I took loans from this app two time's. one is personal loan and then busines loan. I have very good experience from this because it's very easy and fast. It's a fraud app. Recommending don't download this app. They are taking 1500 for prime membership but not approved anyloan. We didn't get any response from their mail I'd and customer care number always busy. Very disgusting app forever. Good Application for Personal Loan. It is very easy to use. All process is Paperless. I am very happy to use this app. Support team is also very friendly. Thank you RBS Team. Super handy app! I was really impressed by how easy and secure it was to apply for a loan. The process is simple and Paperless. RBS is a great app, it helped me out of a sticky situation and it was so easy to get the loan. I am very happy to use this excellent Personal loan App. It is very bad application no loan is available on thi app, I had applied loan after reading its reviews, they said for prime card, bought that too, but even after 3 days no response waas received, customer care does not receive calls. Hopefully it's good and easy to sign up for Loans, which require Membership Card. Once through, after paying the membership fee, Loan amount will be in my account in about an hour. Fantastic, It is the first time for me to contact such a simple Loan platform. Really it’s really well worth the use of this excellent loan application for processing instant loan and I’m impressed with a features and suggest to put in this loan providing app to all my buddies 😛 Great Experience with this app. All features are good. I recommend this app happily who is very needy. I like it very much. This application is very safe and secure 👍..Receive calls regarding mortgage with good information on me helping to save.This is the right person loan for you.fees and rate of interest is very low..It is very trusty app..You all can also trust the RBS app.Staff were incredibly helpful and efficient.the application is very smooth and safe.i got my loan amount very quickly..it is very nice application.very good features over play Store. This is the best app 24*7 help supportive app for ours. Best and most trusty app for taking loans on play store. It is very easy to take loans and also it is available 24×7 , so in emergency also it will be the best option for taking loan. Well I m sharing my personal review after using this app from 8 months..I get good experience from it nd surely I can say it's a good app ..users will not be disappointed by it..they get good experience as well as I got ☺️ RBS is Best Personal Loan Application. It is very easy to operate. It is also Paperless. I am very happy to use this application. I recommended my all friends to Download this Amazing Application. RBS is the best loan app. No paper work. All process is simple and trustworthy. Good experience. I have got the approval of credit limit but the amount is not credited to the account and i have called to the customer support number but there is no one to answer. This app doesn't work at all....They will just take Rs.1499 in name of membership card and after that they will delay the process. I called the customer support they always say to wait for 2-3 days after 2 days when you again call again they will say to wait for 2-3 days....I also sent an email to then same thing they replied on mail to wait. I am having some medical emergency thats why I applied for loan. They doesn't take any initiative and don't do anything only they takes money from customer Good app for personal small loan. All features are good and smooth. Overall app is great 👍. Very good, excellent app. Service very fast and support from staff is so great.I like this App service 100%. It's been 3 days no one contacted and nor reply anything in email. Useless just to collect data Please check your email i have provided my name ans my number and your customer care number is totally worthless I have tried more then 20 times That's really amazing platform for online personal loan service it's very easy to get instant personal loan so highly recommended to everyone RBS loan app is very simple and unique. It offers loan at cheapest interest rate. It has easy EMI option. I applied here loan before 8 days. But till date my loan status not updated. I already pay prime membership 1499 Rs. On that day they called me and told me that next seven working days your loan will be disbursed, but no any information. I applied here for emergency but they are not serious only collect 1499Rs. It is very bad application, I had applied loan after reading its reviews, they said for prime card, bought that too, but even after 3 days no response was received, customer care does not receive calls. May i know what is the link between loan and member ship card ??? By seeing all negative and positive reviews i got to know that it's a just app that linked with all the loan apps and i u are eligible than according to that they is farward your application to the respective apps , for that they are charging 1500 rs .so Better to avoid this app go through with the apps in Play Store directly to save 1500 rs. And positive reviews are some are paid reviews and some are employees of same company. Great service and every verification is done instantly. Thank you RBS for helping me. RBS Loan app is the best platform for personal loans. As this app provides loans very easily and on very less interset in comparison to banks. Rbs loan is very easy speed up app with fantastic future to optimise and enhance their performance very good mobile app.+ Don't fall into this application. They will collect 1499 as membership fee but will not provide any update or loan. They will not even reply to your mail. Unable to upload documents. Not getting help in uploading it. Customer care no. Not working Card not issued even after paying fees Card fees payment options not on app they tell u to pay this by third party apps which is suspescious Loan approved but amount not credited,Only data collection... Fake application. Third class Application This App really help me a lot especially in time of emergency. I'm Completely Satisfied. I just applied for loan because of positive reviews, let's see what will happen , for now I give one start for his user friendly app and surely I will change my rating if i find his service smooth and easy after upload all document and when i click on submit document it show no internet ..but my internet is working very good ..plz solve my problem and provide loan RBS is authentic and only for those with good credit history. Great Experience. I applied for loan 3 days back but still didn't get any reply from those customer care after when I become prime member. That's very sad Superb. It was amazing experience to me, I get loan from RBS. Customer care always helping. I am trying since long but no issues show 50000 approved card approved but asking payment to pay.

But tried and share mail now they were saying application is not registered. Please improve your customer care services because it's being a harasment to us. Very poor Customer support. Always facing server error issues. My loan application is still pending even after successful e mandate from my bank. Every time I call their customer care they tell the same dialog that is we are working on it. Worst app I've ever seen, uploaded all the documents but my application is still pending. And even it's been more than a month but still my application is pending. And even auto debit emi is started before getting a loan? How this is possible? I mean this type of big finance companies can also do fraud things? Is there anyone loyal.

This is a useless app, all the documents have been verified, but it has been three days and the process is still going on, Their emis are activated before getting the loan, how is it possible? Wasteful app Ver Bad Application.When I filed personal details and net banking, I got a limit of 2 lakhs. But when I applied for the loan, my application was rejected. Very Very Bad app. These applications do not give loans, they only take our data and use it in wrong way. I am not able to do e-mandate for my loan no-46724 for 30000 rupees from last 11 days and it is showing emi date in the app without disbursement of loan amount and always showing e-mandate error while completing e-mandate.kindly resolve the issue as early as possible.

Amd i am sure the emi amount will be deibited to ur bank account. This is new style of fraud app .. Donot load this app and donot waste ur time . Tottaly fraud app..no custemer services as well. Applying loan is simple and easy to understand process but still it's been 48 hours my profile is not verified still saying its under review. No reply on contact us chat and not even on email. In mean time no call no message pinged for loan update and what so ever.. process is good but experience is not that great Very worst customer service, i have complete my loan application successfully form 4 days but still now it is under pending. I have told their customer service but no response from their sides. Loan agreement send. E manded activate. Now 10 days over after applying the loan. But amount not disbursed. There was no contact number mentioned in app. Also no response from chat. Totally fake. Before applying be careful. I applied to my money application on 30.11.2022 and submit my all documents .my application verification is completed and loan verification still now pending.4.12.2022 my money representative WhatsApp contact me and she want to me my shelfi photo.

Dear Team, i was approved for a limit of 38,000. Its been a month, but till now i was not credit with the amount. All kindoff verifications been completed but not yet responded. What do we do next ? Emandate also been done. Please let us know ! Useless app....been verified nd all even e-mandation process done successfully still my application is pending from last few days....no response from their contact support or help desk....worst app ever. I was skeptical at the beginning as I saw many negetive reviews before downloading. But I tried and trust me this app really works. It took 5 days but they actually disbursed the amount to my bank account. Thank you MyMoney. Very easy process and quick disbursal i got a small loan within 3 days after applying on this app. It's very easy and supported to start a small kind of business like shop,food point etc.thanx One of the worst lending app you ever come across.After generating loan offer through your bank statemets,cibil check and completion of all the process,you reach the last step for disbursment and you recieve a notification that your loan is not approved.I guess just a scam to get your data.There are far more better trust-worthy brand than this.I regret applying over here. I have been received a credit limit of 25000 for period of 2 years , after doing successful emandate, received a pdf with all the loan details and repayment schedule mentioned in it but it's been a week that loan is not disbursed, have even mailed them but no response. My all documents has been verified but still pending , it's shows under review, that is wired, either it will be yes or no, but this kind of service not expected Worst app I applied loan on 3rd December but still it shows your profile is under review no update from their side and we cannot able to contact any person for same and no update from their side Worst app I've ever seen, Uploaded all my documents but my application is still pending after sanctions loan, and even auto debit emi is started before getting a loan Customer care is not responding. Please disbursed or reject my loan application Worst app simply waste of time it showed me eligible for loan after completing all process only its showing loan verification pending and no response from my money team also customer care number always doesn't connects Very bad app i have ever seen cuze i have applying a loan on Friday but that loan are not transferred in my bank account they showing me pending option but i have clear my documents today Monday but no one has call and solve my problem in costumer service centre i need money And showing emi date before loan transaction how is it possible No Customer service number provided no chat support provided. Verification pending from 5 days & still They had me registered e-mandate ... if disbursal is not gonna happen then how should I repay the emi?? Why do u ask for emandate before disbursal. There is no prospect no. Or loan no. Shown in app. .... Worst loan app ever I got a loan of 30000 and completed all documentation process and mandate but till now I haven't received any loan amount now it is more than 10 days. They only collect all data from costumer and after that not replying and no disbursal. they don't share any help line no. very bad service. no response on application. from last 1 month in email they said 24/48 hours they solve our problems. but its 1 month no loan disburse & no response.. really very bad service my business loan has approved also digital and NACH also completed. But till now amount has not been credited to my account. So kindly check and confirm But showing loan approved on 26-11-2022 Customer care number also not connecting Really bad Experience I applied before a week ago and I have done all step even E Mandate also done but still money not credited in my account.. sent u Email again and but no proper response from ur team really bad experience and before recieved loan amount I'll not pay any EMI that's it. I think this app stealing personal info. Bcz first they provide a loan offer Rs.40000. offer .. and then they took all info photo also .. at last they reject the application.. if you couldn't provide a loan plz don't waste people time and there person info.. Worst experience ever all my documents are verified but the application is still pending and I don't know when they will disburse the loan Worst. When I first time apply it's showing u are eligible of 21k in tenure of 2 yrs but when I take forward to next step, it's showing your application was rejected that's why i give 1 star",letstalk,mymoneyapp.co,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,control vibration full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

Mail: care@rupeeredee.com",3.5909934,154973,"I am a very old customer of RupeeRedee. Have taken many loans in the past and the experience was very good. But now after the new update the app does not even open. It continuously gives an error. Tried multiple times but no use. Have mailed customer support many times but get the same reply from them that the technical team is working on the issues. This is going on for the almost 3 weeks now but still no resolution. It really needs some technical supervision for how the application is going to ease the work for end user. Developer must work on the process of login, and database connectivity. Everytime we need to login through OTP, it gets automatically signed off once you close the application. The payments made take really much more time to update. Sometimes even the application doesn't work, like after entering the phone number, and hitting get OTP, it turns to a blank page. Needs techincal improvement. Very user-friendly best loan app with the advantage of applying for a loan within a few hours after downloading the app (now that's quick). However, keep in mind that you are taking out a debt, and it is not free. It can be quite tempting to utilise the money in other ways, so I advise them to use it prudently. A few things could be improved, but nothing significant. Thanks RupeeRedee. With love -MIKOGet a virtual credit right away. App UI is OK kind of. Processing is fast. But interest rate is very high. You can avail only if it is very necessary. Edit : 28/09/22 Earlier I had rated 4 stars but now it's one star because the app doesn't show anything about the application status. And if you try connecting to customer service the response is not there. I had applied for a loan. I got messages stating that loan application approved and procede further with the link provided. But it didn't work. Worst experience ever. The updated version of the app is horrible, wouldn't even open. Finance wise the application is really good, but application wise the new update is filled with bugs. It is really annoying. Also despite of making the payment the updated app is showing default due status. And I am not even able to check anything on the app. The whole experience is getting really annoying. I have taken a loan on 21st November, with 10 days agreement to pay. But they are updaing as 24th, November payment date. Mailed them then also the tele caller keeps on calling. It's there system glitch but then also behaving like it's my fault. I strongly ask every one not to fall pray of them. Their agreement do not stand any were when system is not updated properly. I have asked to send me link for the period of interest charged till 24th then that is also not send by them. iYesterday I made repayment of 21 488. Every time I have made regular payment. Still my limit was reduced from 21000 to 2000 rupees. And the app doesn't work properly. There is no customer care number only an email address. I was having problem in making repayment but also don't know who to contact. There was only computer mail id also no reply was coming only ticket id was coming. Nothin from the service wise. Probably one of the best loan providers. But consistent bugs in your app, kinda makes it really difficult for the customers to count on it for Tinley loan application As of now, it's been more than 3 days, and I still cannot open your app. Very worst experience. App is useless after the update. They don't even understand what is the exact issue of the customers. Whatever email you send them they don't understand or provide proper guidance. Even their customer support don't work. Better go with some other better applications. Trying from 1 month but the app is not working at all.Previously the app worked good but now from the time they have updated no use you won't be able to login and apply after inserting your mobile number and OTP it's show try again later. Several mails written but yet the app issue is not solved. I closed my first loan and now while trying to apply again, the app is not working.. when I click on Apply button it takes me to a new screen where the UI is just blank and the cursor rotates for a few seconds and take me back to the previous screen to apply.. also next time when I try to login using the OTP, the app doesn't send any OTP. It asks for my phone number and once I click on get OTP a new screen pops up and then get stuck.. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall to get the OTP.. Very Bad experience from this. I have repaid my loan & Got payment confirmation mail. Still they are following up continuously for repayment also On App Loan was showing Overdue. Now Worried about my Civil Score. Also I mailed to Customer support with my concern but no reply received. Wrost experience ever. Suggest to all, please don't download & don't take loan from them. After the recent update though the interface has become worser only one front page which keeps showing something went wrong no matter how many times you apply they keep sending messages to repay and reapply if at you repay and close the loan and are in an idea to reapply please don't it's not going to work when there's an update the version of thr application it should be better not worser than the previous version... Very high rate of interest, the app has lots of technical issues and they keep changing the emi dates from the back, lure lenders but when you apply, it shows no proper loan amount,even after paying the loan,keeps waiting you for days with the app showing you are eligible for a loan, the app seems more untrusted and suspicious. LoL, I am using this app since 5 months. intrest is too high. But when at emergency time it had been helpfull. But after the recent update when I am reapplying for the loan, it is showing that you are not eligible for the loan and Kindly reapply after 4th December 2122 🤦🤦. This is too worst than I thought. I may not live at that time. Truely after the update it's worst than I thought 🤣😡. I had taken screenshot also. Number 1 fraud app, lots of interest and processing fee charges. If payment delays, continuous cheque bounces charge after paying amount also deductes money from account by saying cheque bounce charges. I suggest to all the people don't install and don't take loan from this app, I cleared my dues, still my loan in ""active status"" asking for repayment. Ok daily basis they are sending messages that you can reapply now but whenever I try to log in always it said try again try again..and it is happening from last 1 month..1st time the process was easy but after I paid my loan and reply always it is showing the same thing..pathetic service...editing 2...,it's been so many days from my review and mail as well but still no response I am availing the loan facility from last 2- 3 months..but when my credit line goes high it stopped working.. I am trying to take the loan but when I open the App it stops. App is not working properly. App does not work post update, have used it when it has the web based and app but it just does not work and there is no customer care contact to speak to someone and email does not work, it just keeps saying you don't have access you can apply after 2days and just continues the same way every two days. Pathetic.. My previous experience was great, but this time I paid the full loan amount 5 days before the due date, but not updated in the app and still showing active and also got a payment link in my email, please close the loan because I already paid the full loan amount. Dear Team, i am existing customers of RupeeRedee application but still last one month application is not working proper i am really surprised and also disappointed because your old application version is perfect and user friendly but now version is not proper work so please give me positive response what is the actual issue. Thanks Its been two days since i have registered for the e mandate But the amount is showing still in process . I have been using it for last 8 months but never faced such a pathetic condition. App is under the worse condition after update First thing first please explain how can you let your application down for the longest time without fixing it. Secondly, after making several emails to you and asking for the fix you had emailed me the payment link against the amount owed to which I did made the payment which is going to due on the 3rd Feb 2023 and I got the confirmation payment from you over a call with your customer representative yesterday, the 31st Jan 2023 and on the email too. But still I get calls and reminders. Had good experience in previous loan. Now this app has gone so worse. No point of contact to customer service and no use of paying so much of roi.. No help given since a month from the customer service. Uninstalling the app and won't recommend also to any one.. Worst Update Hello Team, I have been using your app for months and I’m closing all my dues before due date. Today I closed loan before 4 days and when I try to apply for new loan nothing happens and backs to main screen. And when it comes to application, there is nothing in it and has only one page which says to apply loan and nothing works. Please do needful.. Their service is not good, After how many days will update after auto debit. Overdue is visible, how is this, when auto debit is sussful, then why is this.First of all stop bothering people. If you are sitting with the app open then it should work properly. They keep doing anything unnecessarily. After auto debit is successful, you will do auto debit again which is showing overdue on the app. I have paid the loan which I took and paid a lot of charges almost double of what I borrowed. It's been 5 months i have paid but it is still show payment pending on my credit report and affecting it negatively. Please take loan from such app if you only want to decrease your credit score. Older version(4months back) of the app was great ,new version of the app is worse as it takes 24 hours to close loan after paying and you can't apply for new loan for atleast 72 hours. New version says Bugs fixed & faster loan process but eventually it all slowed down the whole process whether settling down of loan or a new loan. My first experience was good with this app, but due to some medical issues at home payments got delayed but i cleared everything and now the app has been upgraded with new look but normally after upgrading the system process should be easy but with this app is Fully different. I want to reapply the loan and i applied. Normally if any app is not approving your loan right now then they give a time period of 1 month or 2 months after that you can reapply but here we need 100 years 😃😃🙆 next 2122. This used to be to good till new upgrade. I have applied and repaid several times over past year but suddenly after new upgrade they required video kyc. There was first a technical error.. i almost waited for two jours and was not connected. This was same for four days. Then today i finally got thru an agent. I have only copy of my pan and all other documents but she said needed orginal doc for PAN and disconnected the call. Why is video kyc being done after i have been a good customer awesome app with fastest approval process. As claimed this app is really fast and they are truly digital.. impressed with the first time transaction with the application. update comment- 10 Jan 2023 Team facing issues applying for loan as the screen just comes back to initial screen after applying loan. does not throw any error. can you please help to clear the issue. This app was good earlier, But now its worst & Pathetic everyday new issues comes up. Once doesnt get logged in & sometimes if we login also its shows access denied inspite of writing multiple mails and messages there is no resolution for the problem so i have stopped using this app I am very dissapoint with this app i will paid my loan with in before time but at this time when i apply for loan app is automatically close please resolved it. Customer service is very bad. If you unable to solve this problem i request to google please remove this app in playstore immediately. and all those app whoose don't give loan but they are only collect the document. Despite paying on time we are abruptly stopped on not getting the loan. I wrote to your email address already,... Mentioned there is a technical glitch to reapply. What kind of technical bug which is not at all fixed. The last update made is 23rd Dec 2022.Please maintain transparency atleast we will uninstall and check other options.. Not working the app right now, One month back the applecation worked properly. Now there is not showing anything. The update version of the application is bad. After updating your your app has become worst so many bugs since 15 days iam trying still the same error emailed u guys your team is saying will fix this in 7 days from past 15 days . Third class app I think you should close this app and sit at home otherwise hire a good software developer/engg. This app is good for nothing useless. If u can't fix a simple bug from past 15 days. Very very disappointed. Never had issues with app all these months.. But recently facing so many new glitches.. Payment done before the due date.. still not updated in the app.. Keeps signing out everytime I close the app. It's annoying You need to improve your app It has been 24 hour I have repaid my loan but it is not updated yet after contact the customer support and several email I just get that it is updated within 24 to 48 hours. Why it is not updated quickly and also your technical team need to work on your app it is not working properly after submitting the mobile number the screen it got white and not giving any OTP Your app deserves negative ratings.. It has been more than 48 hours Since my loan approved and it has not been disbursed till now and app says it usually takes 5 minutes for that. Moreover none of your communication channel works to sort things. Please close down of you are not able to provide services.. After updation of app it is not working please check.. So many times i tried but otp wil come, after applying it showing countdown time it wil starr from 2800 seconds to 0 seconds it is very very long duration not possible to wait any customers. Remove this app from play store these type of loan apps... It is not elegible for one star also...",care,rupeeredee.com,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,access Bluetooth settings change your audio settings connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi full network access pair with Bluetooth devices prevent device from sleeping read Google service configuration view network connections modify or delete the contents of your USB storage read the contents of your USB storage receive data from Internet,0

I just uploaded all my required documents in the app, and the next day, I got the notification that the loan had been approved. Thanks, Lendingkart. These comapnies are just a scam.. They have taken all the required documents deducted money from my account and after that showing you are not eligible... They are just the scammers... Dont go for it Don't even download this chit. They keep on calling you every hour for everyday untill you take some loan from them. And after that they call 3-4 times per hour. An useless, spamming app. This is a disaster company and the app is useless as well. I regret taking loan from this organization. I keep paying my EMIs on time but they take so much time to update. You need to keep constant track of your EMIs. If it is not updated, you'll get overdue amount messages. Moreover, their mail support and chat support are useless, they don't know anything. Now I'm looking to take another loan just to close this damn loan. Biggest mistake of my life. Don't go for Top-up Loan anyway. we received a msg from Lendingkart that we are eligible for top-up. In that message they inform us that ""Without any documentation, Fast processing and fast disbursal "" also it is pre-approved. After that when we did all the formalities by online including NACH, they have started calls again we need to be submitted documents while their verification staff. We are getting lot of confusion, because already they informed it is pre-approved. In future also we don't This is totaly a SCAM! After taking my Bank Details, Statement, PAN, AADHAR, UDYAM Certificate... they have just left a text ""due to insufficient balance in your account, your loan application has been rejected!"" After that none from their end has replied my text or call till now. N.B. - My CIBIL score is 750+ My annual transaction is 1 Cr + Now I am afraid of the misuse of my personal and banking data! Very bad experience coz I tried to open application and wanted to check update their nothing just it's loading I request that I need loan for my business do contact me and help me out. Don't apply for Loan, wastage of time, I rejected this loan, although they call very day, they have no system for customers voice mentioned. Useing very cheap software, they have no senior management person, only tellicaller conversation with you, nobody is senior manager or head connect with you, Very bad management, they are not doing loan only getting documents and KYC and doing only time pass. Worst app. After submiting everything they keep on demanding more documents. Now they are not attending mes Or not getting any updates in mail also. Wastage of time and lost the hope also Very Bad experience after downloading this app. They called me more than 10 time in a day send unnecessary e-mails ....plz don't use this app Worst app don't I nstall. No response from customer care .I am existing customer . And I am unable to login I mailed so many times to customer service but no response. Don't apply loan also . Very high interest rates. Very worst app. After collecting all documents they rejected. I submit my documents for 30 times.they all rejected. So don't ur documents.don't install this app, they send what's app message and collect bank statements, and tell ur are rejected. Fraud Documents not taking uploading.error came during uploading The loan was quick and I could quickly get a personal loan done for me when no one else would give me loan. Yes, the interest rates are a little higher, but the process was easy, fast, and quick. I recommend it if you're in a pinch and trying to consolidate debt. App is not working properly. Error msg is coming that - something went wrong , we're having issues loading the page.. They just need financial information for data sale may be, they won't provide any loan. I have excellent cibil and financial record, still they wasted time and took information..and in end rejected. Total waste of time, don't ever think about taking loan from lendingkart, just google for reviews before getting trapped. Error in uploading Address Proof and GST return. Drop selection done but not showing. Totally fake, provided all the documents and then said your business loan has rejected. But our profile is very strong in the credit transaction history n everything. Simply they're collecting the data by attracting that they gonna provide loan., But they never did it. As of my experience it's 101%fake. Please be aware of lending kart and I request not to provide any data to lending kart. They are not capable of giving loans. My application got rejected twice citing lack of financial discipline! So lending kart renders cibil and experian useless as i have 800 score without a single missed payment. This apart 1 year statement of business and savings account had 1000s of transaction with not a single bounced cheque or ecs. but no doesnt count. Dear lending kart, we apply for loan WHEN we are in need of funds and when balance is low in our accounts. Put up a detailed list of your criteria for businesses to get loans. Such a excellent and very helpful app. If ur cibil is good it is easy and very convenient to get some emergency business loan. Best part is when many banks are asking for 100 of documents and high rate of interest lending kart is doing it on less documents with lowest rate of interest. Team is also very helpful.😊😊😊 You do not have sufficient balance in your bank account check We have observed inconsistent revenue in the recent past on your profile This kind of feedback is given.Wrost ever don't waste your time plz ignore this application. All your details are track what ever you r doing etc. Worst service....from 2 months application is pending and no one is reply...no customer support...never apply from this company Loan amount not disbursed yet although after submitting all the documents. No proper response on email support and phone call support. We have already called and emailed several times. Ridiculous. We have already tried approaching you but no response from your team. Very very poor Support. Issue not addressed after several follow-ups, still ticket got closed by executive. Bad bad. If you want to spoil your CIBIL score, then definitely use the landing kart Too many fake application Applied for OD. Each and every formality and documents have been completed. Their site is showing that the amount has been disbursed. But I haven't recieved anything. They don't reply to mail I have sent many mails. Their customer care executive has no idea about Overdraft so they don't understand what's the query. I feel as if they have misused the documents. Maybe I shall have to file a complaint regarding the misuse of documents. Not recommended. Try other sources Folks, if possible. Very bad experiance with lendingkart app nd employee too.... They given only mobile otp based login but after giving correct otp application error appiar ""something went wrong"". Frustrated with lendingkart.... I applied for the loan on previous month dated 25-08-22 but still showing'in progress' very slow response thank you! Not trustworthy at all. I get a text message saying my application for loan has been approved. I never applied for any kind of loan anywhere ever. Clearly this is just a marketing technique. How the hell did you get my number anyway? Leaving this review as a warning to you to stop this nonsense business practice. If you are really capable you would not resort to such cheap methods to get customers. Y are hell are make this app for its not working crash dashboard always showing ERR_FAILED Waste of time , app is not working properly , so late .. Fraud Organization, initially they collected all my documents twice. Then the loan was approved , now online if i check it says agreement has sent to ur registered address, when contacted they say my loan has been rejected as they are not able to verify our org. These people are not well trained and have less knowledge, inspite of providing the registration documents and all they approved it first and again they decline. I request all to avoid all private finance companies. Something went wrong to issue load page .this only shown waste of time Thank you for asking my phone number, but I don't want to waste more time talking to you. I have already mailed the details to you and your colleagues. I sent them messages on WhatsApp too, to unlock my Amazon account in the earliest so that I can get the sanctioned amount from the other lender who approved my loan. I have waited for three days now. It's giving me a headache experience. In future, do the proper verification first and sent the loan offer letter after that. Hope it helps. Totally waste of time. They collect all documents from you and simply say that you haven't enough balance in account that's why you not get loan. When they collect docs from you they will call again and again after that they not respond your call and sms or email. Just only data collection. If anybody have enough bank balance why he/she will take loan. That's mean who have bank balance only they get loan from them otherwise who suffer from bad time they are surely rejected from lending kart. Loan rejected due to inconsistent revenue in the past. Makes no sense, don't undetstand what is inconsistent revenue per LK, business does not operate like a salaried person, so the income of a business will have fluctuations. Wasted time and effort. Edit:05/12/19- Emailed the registeref contact details more than a month ago but haven't even recieved any acknowledgement. Pathetic! Not useful for small start-ups who need instant funding, I installed this app by seeing advertisement in TV and just placed few formal details but with that small information itself they said you're not eligible for loan because of business revenue is low . If we have good revenue why will we need a loan from a app we can go to the bank and take, all start-ups need funding to grow their business. I think this is not a right application for the business loans. For A Fintech Company this app is a big zero friendly and interactive, Please engage good technical assistance and pay them well and wish you grow bigger than your competitors. The features of App is very good. But if the preclosure amount is also visible then it will be very very useful to the genuine customers as they will come to know if they want to clear the total amount how much have to pay for preclosure. Kindly request you guys to add this option of preclosure amount. Thank you 5 days over my application is still in progress. Toh slow app. Totally waste of time. Very Good experience and fast too. I am happy with supporting staf, they are friendly and quick. But little bit upsate with documantation and timing. Overall it was my first and very good credity. Thanks lendingkart team, keep up the good journey.",app-support,lendingkart.com,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,change your audio settings full network access prevent device from sleeping run at startup view network connections receive data from Internet,0

We not only provide high loan amounts, but also provide a 24 hour guaranteed disbursal or we waive your entire processing fees.

They key features of our process are: 

⏱ 24 Hour Disbursal or 0 Processing Fees
💸 0 Foreclosure Charges. Pre-pay in full whenever you want. 
💯 Pre-approved process ensures highest disbursal rates. 

While our exact interest rates, processing fees etc. are primarily derived of the credit history of the borrower, they fall within the following ranges: 

Loan amount: ₹50,000 to ₹3,00,000
Interest rates: 12% to 32% per annum (on a reducing balance basis)
Tenure: 6 to 24 months
Processing fees: 1.5% to 4.5% (Min ₹750+GST & Max ₹6,000+GST)

Loan Calculation Example:
Disbursal Amount (Amount to be received in account): ₹1,20,001
Monthly EMI: ₹9,975
Interest Rate: 19.99% P.A
Resultant Tenor: 14 months
Processing Fee: 2.5% of Loan Amount = ₹3091

If luckily calls get connected, only fake assurances from other side. Hi everyone please note this......NIRO is the best app ever I have seen ... To easy. E Initially I thought this is just the fake but later I came to know this is awesome app in terms of loan disbursement.. Very minimum document. Thank a lot NIRO TEAM. This is just a new way of scam. Please guys never install this app. They will make you go through all the process like as if they are ligit. But no, they are not. They just want to complete mandate with your account. So that they can auto debit the money from you bank account. They are not going to provide you any loan. Instead they will take away whatever you have. Surprisingly seamless experience considering this was the first time I applied for a big amount . . Got mine in a day .. Support was very professional I have been in need of a loan and I was refuting all the ones that I found online with long credit checks, long waiting periods, and high interests. Then I came to this app and it's just so convenient. No credit check and no complicated application, just upload a few photos of your documents and wait for the reply. Niro app is awesome. I applied my personal loan they verified my details same day and disbursed amount next day. Thanks to Mr. Shashank s . He is call centre representative, he guided me step by step till disbursal. But this app ask my mobile media access. This is only I feel bad. Otherwise very good app for take a loan Thank you Mrs Ayesha for the seemless experience. I have recently applied for a loan. My application got approved and I got the amount credited in just 24 hrs. Keep it up. I found it too quick. The whole process just took 2 days.Team was very cooperative. Many times I got stuck with the app, upon reaching her she made the whole process smooth and effortlessly. I do agree the intetest rates and the processing fees are way high but overall I am happy as I very much required the money. Thanks Niro & thanks ! Good luck! Very bad experience, firstly they invite you for applying pre-approved loan and collect all documents and bank details and everything and before any confirmation they activate your nach. And suddenly say your loan is rejected and they disappear . This is fraud loan app, don't trust this kind of app. Very good. Thank you Shashank S sir for your help when required. Thank you niro and Shashank S for always being so cooperative and helpful. Thanks to niro app for approving loan on time, Mr. Mano helped and guided to for faster disbursement of loan.. Thanks to niro and Mano for quick quidence. We can trust this loan app, verification process is genuine. This app is very nice n lovely bcoz service very good n fast...n staff very kind person thank u so much Niro app for giving me support. Awesome app.Great experience. Special thanks to Syed Aftab who helped me throughout the process. Niro is very good and fast and brindha is friendly and very helpful. Thanks for her.

Paying emi for their delay Grt experience with Niro,all formalities is very easy,100%use full app. Process was easy and got the loan dispersed quickly. Mahalaxmi was very helpful in coordination and get the work done very fast I am a salaried professional and I always have trouble managing my cash flow on time. Occasionally I need to get some cash in advance and I have tried a lot of different resources but they are either hard to use or don't work for me. I was looking for an app that would help me get personal loan but also be convenient. Niro gave me a pre-aprooved offer at a right time. Not worth for an half star atleast. They invite by calling and telling pre approved and showing disbursement details etc...then it shows loan can't be approved. Worst of the worst application..time waste. I suggest not to use this. Save your time and cibil effect. Really helpful app for pre loan for your requirement especially team give personal interest to resolve if we face any issue. I got total support from Syed aftab sir who helped me in all steps thanks a lot sir for your support. Can apply without any issues. I really like the process and app. Everything is digital no need of any physical documentation. My profile process is completed in below 24 hours. Thanks to Hema for smooth processing of my profile.

First they ask all details of all bank particulars including ATM PIN SO THAT I GOT DOUBT BUT NO DOUBT WE CAN OROCEED WIRH OUT FEAR Very fast disbursal of loan very helpful for a needy especially thanks to Mr.Manohar who guide me properly.

Thank you for being the reason I smile Jyothi ma'am 🥰 It was a smooth process till the documentation and approval but the disbursal took a very long time. This could be due to multiple holidays last week. Happy with the support. Thanks. Loan service is good and am not having any issues on it. But the app is not good. There is no option to reach the customer service or contact the authorised persons for any queries. App should improve for customer needs The process was as smooth as silk.

PayU Finance India Private Limited (“PayU Finance”)
https://www.payufin.in/",4.4481645,324538,"Honestly I don't really see the point of having Lazypay. Not getting any benefit as such, just making quick payments on the few merchants I use from the supported one's. You could easily do that with any other payment medium. And if 'paying later' on a kiddish credit limit given to the user is the only selling point, with users having almost no control over a limit increase. Then the entire business idea can be replaced by any bank issued credit card which would easily have a good credit limit. Disappointed with payback feature. I have clicked on pay button, but it's not responding. I have tried multiple times. Result, 18% fine including the great GST. I have logged in through chrome and paid the due. I wrote a positive feedback in the past. If it is a technical error, we may accept it once. If it is a cheap trick to earn money, it would be a cheap trick for sure. Got charged a late fee twice despite having set up an auto debit mandate through their app. The amount is small but not worth the hassle. The first time they reversed it, the second time I was given increasingly ridiculous explanations. I am now trying to close my account. I'm getting the sense that too will be made very difficult for me. In general, it is better to avoid companies like this, which don't intend to be straight with you. This is a completely fake app. After filling all the primary quiries, it shows turn on your location, it was already on but the process doesn't move. What a joke ! You are sending messages. What are your problems? I don't want to try again. Don't send messages. I must block all the sources of text messages. Another finny thing this developer sends email twice and says you may opt out, when I try for it, it shows error 404. I again realise it is a fake app. The location is on and it says off. What a useless credit line! They show the logo of many online apps but actually their service is not available with any of them. Only a very few online platforms allow LazyPay option and those apps are the ones which we don't use often. So the credit line is not usable. Really a pathetic experience. I have already explained the issue clearly here, I don't think I need to do an email to you as you have demanded below. It's your turn to associate with more online platforms to get more business. It's a use less app with a higher credit limit. It doesn't have a card facility,it doesn't have a scan facility,it doesn't have a amount transfer facility,it does not have a bill payment facility.Online merchant facility is also very limited. With out any of these facilities how can I use the credit limit,just making your customers and yourself as fools . It gives a limit with out facility to use,so it's waste of signing up. Initially this app used to be very good and smooth. I used this app very frequently. But after the changes in RBI guidelines and update in App, this app is now worse. My card is stolen since 2-3 months, there is no option to deactivate/disable card, no option to even know your card details. Request you to close my account permanently please. I will be very thankful. I really don't understand what is the purpose of this App. It shows credit limit 10000/- RS in our dashboard but we can't use that credit limit as It doesn't support for any of the vendor payment. It doenst have any pay later functionality. However some other apps like Simpl does well than this app. Useless app. I used it for the first time. Payment time tad bit concerned. Have to use it diligently. Short term is not interesting. I am just getting the hang of using the app. I have used it satisfactorily. Useful instrument in emergencies for people having consistent income. I have never been able to use full sanctioned amount since I began using the service. Worst app ever. Especially for customer service after telling them payment will be done on certain date after the due date and when i agreed to pay the fine they still started calling back to back everyday. I have totally received 20 calls from lazy from different soam numbers and doesn't speak kannada. Highly unprofessional and unorganised app. Repayment cycle is completely useless. If i have to pay the amount in the same month then i don't see a point of using this app. Atleast a month should be given to pay the bill. Also, missing payment on the due date results in harassment by the agents in the form of multiple calls. Deleting this useless app and saving up some space in my phone Disappointed I was charged late fee multiple times because of late repayment. I was facing issues from your end of failure of payment. I had activated the auto debit of repayment didn't worked And some the people from the customer services were calling me uncountablly to do the payment And the payment was just 684 rs and delay happened only once but lazy pay blocked me from using the app This is my 3rd review, first 2 reviews I was satisfied with the service from 2 years but now everything changed. First card service stopped which is very disappointing. Second thing no scan and pay option for me, that means no use of this app at all. At least they should provide scan and pay option if can't give card. I hope I will get it. Thanks I still have 1790 credit limit but still i can't able to use it always shows that ur credit limit is less that transaction, even i never failed to pay, everytime i used to pay before due date, but this happening to me every single time. I'm totally disappointed and i don't even get customer care to solve the problem, please someone helpme out with this Everything was going fine until the new update. Payment processing, everything was okay. But now the whole app has turned upside down with the latest update. Doesnt show up the payment page, or the loan section payment page and everything. Everytime you pay up the dues it shows techincal issues. Please do something or im uninstalling it. Dont fall prey. They cancelled the previous card. You cannot get the new credit card even if you have a good credit score and good salart it will say you are not eligible. There is no customer care number or way to chat with them directly. I wanted to delete my account and all details but there is no way to do that. The app is the best!! But one thing I hated about it is, its customer service accociates are very harsh and mean. Another thing is that I ordered food from it for ₹720 and i just forgot to pay it and after one day of due, they charged me ₹320.2. This is very bad, if a person uses your app you get money but if you are charging more than cost its bad. They could have called and reminded me for the payment but they didnt because they want to charge the ₹320.2 for no reason!!! Very disappointed, i have made all my payments correctly, now unable to use lazypay as it's not seen in any merchant apps, contacted customer care number of times..but have not got a proper response yet...i can see 2400 as available credit limit but got response from customer care as my limit is reached....very disappointed why does the limit fluctuate on it's own...when all payments are made regularly why is the limit decreased from ,4500 to 2500..? This app I don't know how it works don't get fooled by installing this app I had made a double payment since they said the didn't receive the payment so I made second payment. Both the amount got debited from my account and after mailing them thrice regarding this issue I haven't got any response from the other side. This platform used to be amazing. Recently my credit limit was reduced from 15k to 10k despite clearing my dues on time; sometimes even 10 days before the due date. I haven't defaulted even once. The card services have been paused as well. I am not sure why my loyalty has been negatively 'rewarded'. I request lazypay that if they were to respond to this review, kindly do not copy-paste standard text - please address my issues. In simple my credit limit started with 4100rs I use it extensively and now my credit limit is 9100rs. In Lazypay my limit started with 500rs I have used it several times and always repayed before time, after 6 months they increased my limit to 700rs and then 1000rs and when I used that 1000rs and repayed the next day they reduced my limit to 700rs again. So it is useless to keep this app installed, they hardly ever increase your credit limit and decrease it again without any reason. Poor experience. Have been charged late fees of 300 + 150 interest multiple times despite making the payment max a day late. Even credit card companies give 2 days credit for payment after due date as per RBI guidelines. Unbelievable this is! Not to mention even higher late fees that I had been charged on lazy card (500 and above) which was not refunded despite requesting customer care over multiple emails! Really hopeless. Never using again until things improve drastically! I have been using this app from last 5 years, and last three months ago. Everything was working fine. But now it is not giving any option like scan pay or digital card. Very unhappy The customer support is of no use when they say drop an email, I am calling you to get a solution. I was looking to foreclose the xpress loan, the app is not set up with an easy way of closing the loan they want us to email them and after emaling they respond back asking me to confirm when I already stated I want to foreclose, now there is no response back to my emails, This is the worst experience with Lazy pay, This is the last ill be using. Since credit card option is not available from Nov 22. You guys should update your app so that eligible person pay their bills or recharges through the available limits just like Simple pay app. Else it's meaningless to give credit limit to any one. It was a great app but now it's just redundant and useless, unable to apply for the new credit card. Every time I try it says sorry something's broken. If you do not wish to give the credit card then why do you even send notifications and messages every 2nd day I've been using lazy pay for a long time now. But recently they started charging Rs 300 + (3-5%) penalty charges for the total spend of Rs 700 when you delay the repayment by 12hrs(due to technical issues in your app). You won't even get to know these hidden penalties unless you actually go and check. They bait you by saying they have increased the credit limit, however they charge you hefty penalties without letting you know. I definitely wouldn't recommend using Lazypay. I have been a very loyal customer of yours, but for the first time I am very much disappointed as I am not able to use lazypay with any of the merchants like Zomato, swiggy or rapido ... It's showing that the account is inactive. Sorry to say but I think as the days are passing by customer service has been fading . - A highly disappointed customer of yours. Useless and noteworthy app, do not install this app if you later won't to regret. Cash back ""UPTO 100"" going to add credit limit. For that also you have to write mail to them. Later that credit limit is useless. Their are many issues. Read all other people comments to understand in detail. Thanks for reading this and atleast save your time and money. Easy payments on credit. Need to be accepted on more platforms. App is useless for doing anything other than viewing credit limit & making repayments. At starting point i had limit upto 4000 but when i applied lazypay card then they reduce my limit to 1400 and then after they block my card too and now limit not increased Although i paid my bills on time or before time. Waste app, instead i recomend simpl they gave cashback as well and my limit goes upto 11000 but this app is a garbage. Sms OTP is not being sent, either to log in, or to pay on Swiggy, which was working fine since covid. Suddenly, why can't you send customers like myself an sms?? I am NOT on any DND block list, and I get every other OTP under the sun from a dozen apps no problems. All these while it was ok...but now may be new rule i guess,they don't call us on the due date or before for the payment but after a day because they get 295 as late fee for just one day. Well done.. Other apps like Simpl is much better as they remind and also give us an additional date and time for repayment in case we miss the payment coz of situations. Also when i just spoke to a person asking for waiver and he is so ride saying things like if i wish to continue with this app i can else leave Worst experience. They constantly keeps on sending motifs ad well as texts and calls for express cash but whenever I try to apply for it. They say u already have lazypay card though I Don't have one. Support also doesn't reply and they don't even have a helpline number. Messho is telling that they have initiated my refund for the cancelled order, but it is not reflecting in lazypay. It is been more than 9 days, still not received refund. Messho and lazypay is holding customer's money. when i call messho they keep repeating it is initiated, but didn't receive it. It's really annoying with both messho n lazypay. Can only be used for online food delivery apps and cabs booking and the most worst, useless app I have seen, cannot scan and pay or send amount and the late fee is crazily high it's like 50% of the amount we spend must be paid as late fee, I don't recommend to use it, try others Lazy pay is a okay app ,from last so many months it's upi option is not working.scan & pay option is also not working.not a very good app just a normal app. Also now the lazy pay card has stopped working so basically it's a useless app. It just gives a limit of 15000/-;that I could have used somewhere if the lazy pay card works but now it's just a useless app. It is fraud company, their app is not secure don't use it , In my case ,I havenot use this app in past, but because of unsecure app ,someone have used amount on behalf of my mobile no unsecurly ,without generating OTP and registration,after that they keep calling and sending the massage ,to pay the amount which I haven't spent, ,I raised the request to customer care but still they keep sending MSG and calling , I am not able to use the card at any online or offline stores, i don't know what is the problem, i have tried so many ways but the transaction is getting declined, i request customer care to look into the matter at the earliest but they know giving automated response.One of the worst instant credit app, worst to the core customer service.No service at all. I think the executives are sleeping instead of working.Even they are not giving UPI option also. very horrible.....no words it's a good experience, However the options are not able to be found in many payment options except for the movie tickets.

You can use Cibil and Experian for cibil scores along with Crif (personally I don't like Crif). But its good. After all very good improvements, and support. Previous feedback: Server problem all the time. Please improve servers. App is not that bad. But servers are bad, improve that. Worst kind of app ever, the number does not connects just shows Rohit Supekar and that is it even if sometimes it does connects you just hear the busy tone, majority of times they never email you back even though it is urgent, their internal system is slow, and they keep on sending SMS for some issue that has been already paid for. It is a thing of beauty when you guys want customers but once you land them you just let them to wither and die. This app is a straight up nightmare. Doesn't connect to server half the time. If it connects, it will not pull up details. It doesn't show updated balance properly. Doesn't show what is due. Because of the nonsense on this app, L&T agents call and harass me saying payment is pending because they don't have confirmation if payment is done or not. my EMI amount is debited from my account more than once in the same month, and still they don't care about this. Worst app & worst finance, I took personal loan in this app, for past 3 months i pay regularly, i got one message from the app if you pay EMI Previous due date your credit score will be increased. I pay the EMI through this worst app. After that they charge overdue fees, you pay before due date that's why you have to pay overdue fees 350/- ,such a worst people, they called evey 5 minutes clearly your overdue balance. They are feadoff every time on me. My humble request dont take loan. Worst app and worst experience. I took a bike in the month of Sept. I was added in LNT for loans. I was getting auto msges from the app saying please click the below link n download the app n pay the amount before due date. I did the same before the due date and the worst part is payment was not displayed in the app n after 3 days I got my extra charge which was debited from the bank for 560 rs for not paying the amount and the app shows 360 as overdue n its not fair very worst finance I am giving you 0 star.....l&t finace.....😡😡😡😡worst customer care service i have ever experienced... I got a lots of personal loan offer in this app notification... But i can't apply or I can't find anything about that loan offers... So that i called personal loan customer care department... They say's they will call call back you shortly... When they call back the call didn't connect... If connected then they don't know the language... Then they says we will call you back... That repeat😡😡 Seems fake,i have duly followed and completed all the steps for the loan, got the mandate registration and application with pdf of loan agreement details over email however its more than 48 hours and no disbursal yet. The customer care email address just sends an automated mails and no response. The call center numbers just asks to wait for the disbursal. Very bad experience from this fintech i applied for a loan which is pre qualified from there side to me so i applied for it it almost 2days till yet there is no update??? It still showing document under verification when I contact customer care they reply your query will resolve in 48hours ???? But I think they just fooling us I wish there could be negative rating! There is just no way to login as the app says to login via OTP and OTP doesn't come. I have been trying for over a week now Worst app.payments are not updated correctly too worst app.never seen the app like tat.Really disappointed.i gave complaints many times.but not yet corrected.my money only wasted.bcz of too much of slow process.i paid first month due one day before the due date. Bcz of worst service they are not updated correctly.it shows overdue.i don't know what they are doing.worst service.even I paid the overdue also. Still they didn't update.that much of slow process.Really I disappointed and money waste Purely waste service.

If calling customer care they will say to call back..if receive call from them vthout asking anything they disconnecting..also no proper reply from email..purely waste and horrible experience from this app. Dont go with this app It's not working. We provided our mobile number n waited for OTP, severaltimes. But no response. So what's the use of this app Wrost services. I have tried to apply personal loan but the customer service is very bad they didn't responding properly via calls. They calling and disconnecting for past 3 days I got like this so I mailed but also no responses. Runs very slow and doesn't open quickly. Ok, it's bothering me, so please update it quickly so that it works faster. Worse, sometimes the server doesn't work for the app This app is a straight up nightmare. Doesn't connect to server half the time. If it connects, it will not pull up details. It doesn't show updated balance properly. Doesn't show what is due. Because of the nonsense on this app, L&T agents call and harass me saying payment is pending because they don't have confirmation if payment is done or not. my E thish app is verry bad not work in proparly not update in same day please do not install Maximum how score credit. Ur need loan. And one thing some. Credit score low give the little change small. And. Next. We are all increase the credit score. bruh either the app doesn't work or something is wrong with the servers because im a new member to L&T and i am trying to login with my number but i am not even getting the OTP....and not finding any other way to login After entering mobile number and OTP Date of Birth is auto selected and unable to edit. Same with PAN Card. PAN Card details fetched is incorrect and unable to edit. Worst app. Hi I'm sanjivii, I just downloaded this app and it is a nightmare to use. Bad UI & UX. It showed on paisa bazaar that I'm eligible for a personal loan but the app nor the website is not usable. I need to know whether I can avail your services or should I look elsewhere? App doesn't work properly and my application not completed due to technical issues. I tried to complete the application since 12.12.22. Till now it's same. I want to complete my loan application as soon as possible. Please response quickly. My opinion to this app is very bad because many call come to me saying that payment is done or not even do my money is cut from my account but still they are calling me an asking an sending messages to clear my payment an calling me by different numbers simply disterping me even do the payment is done but still they did not update this app is to slow Absolutely worst experience first with the company then with this app. First they will threaten to takeaway your vehicle if you are late to pay emi by 1-2 day. And now even after I have paid my emi for this month and still they are not updating it and making me wait to pay my remaining amount and close the loan. There is no one who is interested in solving my issue neither the customer care nor the office in my town. Absolutely Worst Worst experience ever.. This app didn't show my loan details. Also I can't upload my picture on profile. I am trying to update my KYC details but it didn't show any button or icon to update. Please fix this problem. I am tired now.. Please I won't recommend this company for any type of loan,few days ago I had received a call to close the account and requested amount was already paid through the link send by customer service rep and till date the account is not closed tried using the app tried to get in touch with customer service through email and contact information provided no response from past one month🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡 this is worst company every I have seen in my entire life I need my problem to be solved ASAP There is no use of this app by doing early payment of EMi through this app also they are charging check bounce charges and they're saying ECS is active on your account..that's why they charged me 350rs then what is the use of this app my sending continue messages to install this and do the payments early.... Unnecessarily i paid that extra check bounce charges 350 and i send a mail to the customer care and called serval time there is no use I'm not getting proper response from the team I brought my bike on Sept month my finance loan started an November before that i got repeated message to my registered Mobile number that overdue in which my actually payment is Nov 3 but i paid my money on Nov 2 but it's reflected for 7 days then again they're deducted money in my bankwhen i contact customer care they're no response from them later i mailed in them 5days it'll refund mention after that 7 days over still my money is not refunded..it's worst ever finance to take i experience so Worst app this is to inform when I took bike loan same documents now I have uploaded for personal loan it's says documents have expired when we speak with customer care they will says it's all system approval then why you guys call and ask for personal loan it's really worst some times app will not work it's says try again. App is not working properly only a circle is moving all the time. Worst experience ever. Nice application but one more facility is required in the app, fourclosure amount payment is not reflected in the application, only veiw the pending amount, If customer is disided will close the loan, outstanding payment is not reflected and how to pay all pending amount. I have a sufficient amount in my account.but they collect every month bounce charge and fine amount.worst experience in your financial services.and i visited office,and called customer service too.but no use.every month they doing like that This app is a straight up nightmare. Doesn't connect to server half the time. If it connects, it will not pull up details. It doesn't show updated balance properly. Doesn't show what is due. Because of the nonsense on this app, L&T agents call and harass me saying payment is pending because they don't have confirmation if payment is done or not. Constant harassment every month. There are many fake loan apps in the Playstore but this is absolutely straightforward and truly helping. I wil pay the instalments at the right time .This financial service must grow to any positive level.All the best...

Regrading my overdue charge. I paid my loan amount before the due date.Because your service staff had informed me that there will be no overdue charge even if the payment is made before the due date.Why did your company add my overdue charges after I paid before the due date? Please cancel my overdue charge. Because this is your fault. why did you give me wrong information Worst application ever . Never connected to the internet.

Going to remove this application as it's service is very bad. After 15 days my application is under review and support not respond Fake app .. only collect the data and put the profile on hold for a long without any information and they Enach in starting of a loan amount i don't know they take the loan on another person documents and put the emi load on that document persons . Excellent customer care is provided. They were straightforward in their communication with me and went over the benefits of each app feature. Well, i give 3 star currently because the approval timing is long ...not as they said. My application still pending ..also submited my gst . Lets see what happend . After can give some final review... Its 09/10/2022 final review. This app only collect data and even you can't request to delete. My application is still pending . My businesse has gst .anual turn over 5250400. Fake app . Changing my 3 star to 1 star ...i wish there was a option for minuse star I'm very happy that I came upon the ePayLater app at the perfect time. I was able to invest in my business without any stress because to the quick and simple financing, and the low interest rate was the icing on the cake. Obtaining loans can be quite difficult due to the lengthy verification process. However, I was able to acquire quick credit with the ePayLater app and with the fewest number of verifications. To my joyful surprise, this software is really good. Additionally, everything is 100 percent authentic; there is no fraud or scamming. The ePayLater app is very easy to use and the UI is also quite easy to understand. A good app for an end to end smooth transactions. The tl are very careless they have deducted 142,rs,564rs. And 1063rs From my account without any confirmation and I have also paid all the dues before the due date And I try to the connect with customer service executive and area customer service officer both are not responding properly Although the e-mandate process can be a little cumbersome, once it is complete, you will know right away if the loan amount you asked has been granted or not. This app is awsome it is easy to use & has everything you might need for support I am so happy with it thank you ePay later for helping us & understanding the need of small people like us I signed up as a merchant with ePaylater, and with just a click, I can simply keep track of all of my credits and debits. Simply ensure that you have everything in order and that your credit score is high. As a result, ePayLater would issue you a loan. This aap is not good. I have paid the bill on time after that they deduct money from my account late charge and when I open help centre it is not working. I contacted their support staff since my EPL card was gone. They were all really helpful and quickly resolved the issue. My start-up received no investment interest, and my loan application was rejected. I was able to work on it and expand a lot because of ePayLater. Just 5 days after I submitted my papers and finished the verification process, my loan was automatically credited to my account without any difficulties or additional checks. It's been more than one month no approval I've received so far. Wether it's not approved atleast your company should let me know so that i can try. Pathetic service, still it's showing that pending for approval It is a very user-friendly programme with an intuitive user interface that makes it simple to carry out end-to-end transactions. I would love having a 30 day payment cycle and option to make the payments to the UPI IDs from the simpl balance. Also, an option to sort and categories billbox items would have been a great inclusion. I use this app a lot for the bill payments and it's always a pain to find the intended bill item from my list of items in the billbox. Edit: When are you going to introduce the life/term insurance payments on billbox? Very poor&useless application I got the approval 75000 my mandate completely but i haven't got any credit yet just showing me 000. My profile showing me Under review. Even after everything is successfully but my limit show in 00 sala application just remains chutiya The customer service employees are really helpful. They guided me through the process and addressed every issue I ran into. The ePaylater app has zero glitches and comes in very handy! The app is 100% safe, speaking from personal experience. As someone who has used this software personally, I can vouch for its safety. It works well and is really beneficial. Good Job Team. I have been using this ePayLater app for a year now and I have just one word to describe my experience is ' Incredible'. With the help of ePaylater, my business took a big blow during the pandemic period. I mean the app has literally helped me during my difficult time, Thank you ePayLater. This application is excellent, much to my delight. Furthermore, everything is 100 percent genuine; there is no fraud or scam. The software is quite simple to use. even for individuals with minimal business experience There are no scams and all loans are guaranteed. pathetic app last 24 hrs its showing ur application is under process there is no customer care nothing In awe of how well aligned their overall services are. Everything gets sorted pretty easily. I would like to thank everyone at ePayLater for their promptness. Since my EPL card had vanished, I was strongly recommended to get in touch with their support team. They were all incredibly helpful and handled the problem immediately. When I make a purchase, I always obtain an advantage from ePayLater, such as extra points or a higher credit limit for my next transaction. There is no way to contact the support team The application is pending and it is not progressing for a long time Regarding all the features, giving loans was the best. alot of apps give loans but epay has proven to be the best. I had no idea gaining credit could be that straightforward. I enjoy how ePayLater is constantly on my side. I own a small vegetable store and have always wanted to develop; ePayLater helped me achieve that aim. All thanks to ePayLater everything has become easier for me. It gives the best price for everything. Happened nothing after filling out all the required details. 2 days after filling the application on this app, my phone started receiving messages and emails from different numbers and email ID's for loan requirement. So, it means these people are selling your information without your consent and this is really ridiculous. A zero interest loan with no payments is available right now. Only the ePayLater aap makes this feasible. Try it for yourself to get the finest results! While using the app, never even faced one lag or glitch issue, they have always been great.",support,epaylater.in,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,change your audio settings full network access prevent device from sleeping view network connections receive data from Internet,0

Navi app for personal loan was pretty simple. The interface is good. Unlike some other apps which are pretty complex. Even the interest rate for the loan is average according to the market. My personal experience was amazing. The app is very user friendly and intuitive. I was not successful in several other so called top rated apps but this one was very straight forward and quick with a not bad interest rate. I completed the overall process from installing the app to getting the disbursement in my bank in about 15minutes. Highly recommended. It's providing loan options and collecting all doc details but while doing for mandate to get loan it's showing multiple times error. In which we can't do complete process. Worst application and service. Also no customer support. It's seems doing fraud with all peoples by collecting all information. Need to be investigat before registering in such platform. It's a good app, cash disbursement is quick but the interest rates are much higher than other competitive businesses. And they also gave me an offer for top up in my existing loan but after few hours they changed their mind and said try after 30 days Or you can get lesser amount. I don't know what's that, I've written to them about the issue hope it get resolved These apps are same like Chinese loan apps they just collect data for there own purpose to earn income. If it would have been to delete/ban the app I would have preferred to do the same. When you ask the customer service to delete the data they will give you weird reply stating you reached out to us so we are unable to delete this data. As per my scenario all reviews and the advertisement are just for earning money in terms of data collection Dont take any loan from them. I have taken 35k and i was paying since last 1 year...still 33 thousand outstanding.....they charge 38% interest...nearly amount gets double in 3 months....... They Lie in their advertisements....they charge very high rate of interest after your 2nd or 3rd EMI....later you cant even cancel the loan because you have signed the agreement. And you have to pay 2 times of your loan in 1 year. Don't install this application. They are just playing with you nothing else. I installed and it shows that I can withdraw the amount. However, I completed the KYC. Afterthat I got the option to click a selfie whenever I click on that the capture button is disabled and I am not able to submit it. Worst part it, there is a need help section too when you click on that and select the option that you are unable to click the selfie it always gives you the trouble shoot steps and close the issue. Great This app is really good, user friendly but there is one issue You can't pay your EMI on last day, if you try to pay it will show technical issue for entire day and they will charge interest on the emi. Even though i had money to pay emi i couldn't pay just because of that technical issue. I called technical support to help but she told you should maintain balance before one day or else you can't pay on last day. She said it's Navi app who stops pay now option on last day to charge interest. DeaR Navi App providers, I'm very disappointed to Say that even the smallest app correction you are not able to do. You told me to log in and go through OTP aģgregator option but sadly there is no such option at all in the app. No one has called to recheck in this. Totally disappointed This was my first loan request as I didn't face money shortage ever. 100s of fake apps are running with max processing fees and hidden charges. This is Best Loan App i have used online. No processing fees, no hidden charges. Money deposited within minute. I wish this app grows in future. Thank you Navi for such a wonderful experience. This app is just complete waste. They scan for your information in your phone like SMS, social media etc and displays you a message that Loan is not available without providing any proper reason. They will just show you a prebuilt list of reasons. It is neither user friendly nor helpful. It would be great if Navi can provide the exact reason why the loan is got rejected rather than blindly saying try after 90 days. And there is no option to delete the data that they've tracked too. 👎 They scan your SMS (for Bank transactions) and contacts. After all the scanning the app said I'm qualified for 50k. It wasn't enough for me plus interest was like 30% and I decided to setp away from the loan. Then I was checking whether I can delete all the data they collected from my phone. There's no such settings to do that. After that I collected their support email and wrote a message. But they replied that they will keep my data for risk mitigation and record-keeping measures. There were three worst things that I had noticed. Firstly, they charged high processing fee which is almost 12 per cent and it's really high and it's regressive. Secondly, They're charging very high interest which is 30% in my case, although my credit score is decent and There is no late payments and overdue. Lastly, They might be ruined your credit score because they are desperate to do hard enquiry in your CIBIL whenever you click on cash loan section and it's very annoying. Ridiculous app... keeps nagging with offers and when you actually download it, it just doesn't work. It works fine untill they need access to your data and permissions and once they have it suddenly it doesn't get internet connectivity. Bloody scammers. I have taken more than 5 loans from the app. All paid on time, in fact all pre closed as well. However, now the application shows that I'm ineligible. The credit score has increased from the last time with reduced liabilities. This happened to me in the past as well in this app My account had more than sufficient balance for auto debit and before the due date the facility to prepay the installment was turned off too. You cannot say the payment was late when your app was the one with bugs in it. Not even able to reach customer service! Navi is my first choice for applying personal loan. I have not seen this kind of simple and secure app, that really can give the online loan at our fingertips. The customer service team was really helpful in executing the loan. Overall a smooth experience in availing loan, and would really suggest people try it once. I can get a loan of any amount and at anytime, and it is very easy with emergency loan app. I never have to make an agreement or sign anything. The best part is that you are automatically declined if your credit score falls below, which is fantastic! I am all for this app. Bring a new and detailed homepage. Giva full makeover to the app. Add option for changing bank,adding cards, upi Or netbanking. Revamp the app, make it smooth for users. Bring new tools and features. More detailed home screen is a need. Make the app more smooth, it is very uneasy to use. Very bad experience. I completed all formalities. But I am unable to take selfie. Cleared the cache. Used latest version of app. Used Google Chrome. Default camera fails to take my selfie inspite of all permissions. I was not wearing any hat or glasses. Chat service is a bot which simply terminates the chat without resolving the issue. I am unable to complete my KYC because of a malfunction in the app and there is no way of resolving it. So, although I needed the loan yet I am unable to get it. The app asks you to setup auto-debit mandate which I completed and then takes you to a page asking for a selfie and documents. When I go and try to take a selfie, the capture button is greyed out, help option isn't of any assistance either. Please assist urgently and help to resolve. This app is just complete waste. They scan for your information in your phone like SMS, social media, contacts etc and displays you a message that loan is not available without providing any proper reasons.they will show you a prebuilt list of reasons.and there is no reason to delete data that they've tracked too😡👎👎👎 It's a wonderful app. Immediate disbursement. No precloser charges. And more important interest discount available when we pay before due date. Regular interest also very low compare to other nbfc apps. Tqqq navi In the KYC process whenever I got the option to click a selfie .I am not able to submit it. worst part is , there is need help section too when you click on that and select the option that you are unable to click the selfie it always gives you the troubleshoot steps and close the issue Completely Unstatisfied with their services There is no Proper response of mails and Their Coustmer support was telling to Unistalled the app and I can't be capable to use the App for long run Choose Other Platforms for immediate and instant loan services I taken more than 2 loans from the app.All paid on time, in fact all pre closed as well.However, now the application shows that l'm Ineligible This happened to me in the past as well in this app. This app is just complete waste. I'm very disappointment with this app.. Already itqken 2 loans from this app. And also closed that 2 loans. With proper date. Now the app shown loan offer to me. But apply for loan the bank statement upload option shown only net banking not shown pdf option. In my bank not shown net banking option. What can i do... I'm really very very upset. And i raise tge request to this app through mail. But no response... Thanks😔😔😔 Just fraud for health insurance in market. I have two health insurance policies with Navi since an year now and by the end of the year when I raised the claim for reimbursement in one, they rejected the claim after 15 days saying the previous hospitalization documents not submitted. The documents they ask for are 3 years old when I didn't have a policy with them. And I don't have the documents. They did all the verification but still rejected it. They treat you like you're liable for claims. Worst app there was a link shared for me to connect with them which is also not working. My issue is very simple I am not able to click a selfie and the link you shared to connect with me is also useless. Really waste app. I am not having good experience with this app. I have a sanctioned amount but unable to withdraw it. I have tried so many times but auto debit facility is showing error. I have used live chat option but my problem is not solved. Lier app they don't give you loan except fake talk. In advertisement they are showing instant loans are provided through them but in real they are not always helpful. I took loans many times through kredit bee app and I paid the amount in time and my credit score is also good but what they think they know. Thank you for your tremendous help, by giving loans on time just per clicks without any delay. i haven't seen such a quality app with necessary things for the person who is looking for a personal loan i must tell you guys it is very easy to get and use for any emergency. Great job! Thank you Navi commendable performance and fabulous dates we can choose to repay the emi. I really love Navi App. This is very simple to disburse the loan and better than the bank. They have no longer precess, this is my first choice for applying the loan. Navi response very quickly and transfer the amount within few minutes. So l would like to thanks Navi App. May navi is big scam.After taking all kyc details from customers and setting up of auto pay. After successful of auto pay app show kyc not match and try after one month. They are accessing all your bank details debit card details even pin number also for auto pay. It happens with me.please be careful. Now I am thinking without sanction loan they may auto debit from our account. Their is no option to delete auto pay. Best app for investment part as well. They have give u option to do sip or lumsum amount of min to min amount. You can invest Rs. 10/- also with 0 entry & exit loads. Actually I am also looking this kind of app since long. Process is also smooth. Thanks a lot team Navi & appreciated your work as well. Very bad experience. I have took a small loan from Navi months ago and done the payments correctly. Whenever the reapply or top up option comes, I tried for it but it shows profile not eligible!! If my profile was not eligible, then how did I get existing loan from navi. Everytime this reapply option is mocking me and simply ruining my cibil score. It is indicated as a new loan enquiry. Please check out my profile. App is showing withdraw the amount but whenever putting my account number it's just give an error that the name is not matching on my Bank and Pan, which is definitely a joke. And no support number is there as well. One chat support is there but that's an AI bot replying to me. I Love Navi. I got cash loan literally within 4 mins. It's as simple as filling necessary details. Verify account. tadaa!! Money got credited to the account. Very competitive rate of interest, ZEROO processing charges and preclosure charges. I have not seen anyone else giving this. Thank you Navi!!!! It was really a great experience with Navi. The paperless transaction and the support I received while the process was easy and stress-free. Decent Interest rate, which makes Navi one of the best options among other apps. Thank you Navi and Team, I'll definitely recommend my friends to download this personal loan app. An excellent pocket buddy who doesn't resist you when you need. Mobile friendly, Amazing UI, Affordable commercials, Ease of operation, No hassles in preclosure has made Navi app, find a permanent place in my mobile phone. I am applied for PL and lonan is sanctioned. But I am unable to process Auto debit. My amount also not credited due to this issue. I sent mail to support team. But no response. Very worst service.
