The graphics and gameplay is excellent. But the black screen is consistent. Update did not work. It actually is worse. I have to Uninstaller and install every time I go to play this game. Edit: now when I start the game it.goes.to a black screen. There isn't an update to do. I have no clue what the deal is but the game is even more annoying now. Love the game but i hate the advertising.5,510 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoInvite Code - DEWAN629UVmore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 30, 2022Great app! Recommended for all the sports lover. Really enjoyed watching sports on the app. Definitely a great app for sports fan as there is something for everyone in it... Probably the app with best UI and UX for watching matches online. The match info, scorecard, highlights, playing XI are all visible on the same screen. Best app to watch live sports. One can watch live stats on screen while the content is being streamed in the background. Also you pay for a single match very easily.3,871 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSporta Technologies Private LimitedDecember 30, 2022Thank you for taking out time to review our app. We hope to continue providing you with the best possible experience at Dream11.Shahadat Makranimore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyDecember 7, 2022This is an excellent app. Switching between the scorecard, match reports, and ball-by-ball commentary is simple.
