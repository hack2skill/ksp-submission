This repository is created for Karnataka State Police Hackathon 2023 - submission collection. 
## Team Information
### Team Name - DARKSIDE ASSASSINS
### Problem Statement - AI FACE DETECTION
### Brief about the idea - 

For this hackathon, we developed a new AI model to identify, recognize faces to find missing people, criminals, wanted people against images and videos.
A typical use case of this tool will be when the law enforcement has/finds a suspect on the field and take a picture with their phone/camera to match it with missing/wanted people database which also includes surveillance videos.
Our model is meant to work on images that are blurred/noisy and also have multiple faces in it.
We pre-trained our model with over a petabyte of images (1,00,00,00,000 GB) to provide results with >99.4% accuracy.
We provide APIs that match input faces with a pre-existing police database and also integrate with social media APIs such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok to fetch identities to provide a larger set of identifications.
